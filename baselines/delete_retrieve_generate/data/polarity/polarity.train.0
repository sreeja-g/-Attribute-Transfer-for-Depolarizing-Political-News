" ' I find [ Holocaust deniers ] deeply offensive .
But at the end of the day , I do nt believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong .
I do nt think that they re intentionally getting it wrong . "
That s Facebook co - founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg , all but inviting , during a Recode interview in which he sought to explain why the social network FB , -4.27 % permits controversial and inflammatory sources to maintain their voices on the platform , a wholly new controversy .
On the rival social platform Twitter TWTR , -2.55 % , many users wondered whether Zuckerberg -- having drawn a line between Holocaust denialism and , say , the long - standing claim by Alex Jones of InfoWars and others that the Newtown , Conn. , elementary - school massacre of December 2012 was staged , calling out the latter as a falsehood -- was actually suggesting the facts of the Holocaust were not settled :
" Game of Thrones " led the nominations for the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards , but which expected nominees missed the cut ?
Debra Messing and Eric McCormack of " Will & Grace " The NBC sitcom earned 83 nominations and 16 wins during its original eight - season run , which ended in 2006 .
But the high - rated revival did n't receive the same amount of love , earning just five nominations , including best supporting actress for fan favorite Megan Mullally as Karen .
Co - stars Messing , McCormack and Sean Hayes missed out .
Alison Brie of " GLOW " Netflix 's ' 80s - set women 's wrestling show managed a nod for best comedy series but was down for the count in other major categories .
Potential nominee Brie was overlooked , although co - star Betty Gilpin still punched up with the show 's only other major nomination , as supporting actress .
Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington of " Game of Thrones " HBO 's hit fantasy series was ineligible last year because of its midsummer premiere but was back in the running this year for its seventh season .
Although the Emmy favorite earned a stellar 22 nominations , the most of any series , including best drama , the show earned no leading - actor nods for Emilia Clarke , Sophie Turner and Kit Harrington .
Lena Headey , Peter Dinklage and Nikolaj Coster - Waldau still managed nominations for best supporting actress and actor .
Jeffrey Tambor The two - time Emmy winner , who was nominated just last year for playing a trans woman in " Transparent , " went unnoticed this year after being fired from the Amazon series in February because of sexual harassment allegations .
Both of his shows - " Transparent " and Netflix comedy " Arrested Developed " - missed out in all categories .
Freddie Highmore ABC 's hit freshman medical drama " The Good Doctor " was dead on arrival at the Emmys with zero nominations , despite awards procrastinators ' predictions that Highmore would get a slot as leading actor in a drama .
Roseanne Barr No one really expected ABC 's " Roseanne " revival , last season 's top - rated sitcom , to reap nominations after Barr 's racist tweet in May that got her fired and the show canceled .
Still , the show 's mere two nominations - in editing and supporting actress , for Laurie Metcalf - must have stung .
Kyle MacLachlan and " Twin Peaks " actors The Television Academy was n't having the cherry pie .
David Lynch 's ' 90s cult classic , revived as a limited series on Showtime last year , earned nine nominations , but only in non - acting categories such as cinematography , directing and writing .
MacLachlan and Laura Dern were left out , although Dern snared an acting nod for HBO movie " The Tale , " playing a victim of sexual abuse .
Winona Ryder Justice for Winona : The two - time Oscar nominee made a triumphant comeback in Netflix 's sci - fi smash " Stranger Things , " playing a mom whose son vanishes and is then possessed by an evil monster .
Although co - stars Millie Bobby Brown and David Barbour both netted supporting - actor nominations , Ryder missed out for the second year in a row .
All of " Modern Family " Although the long - running comedy has largely fallen out of critical favor , it has still been a perennial Emmy nominee , garnering 81 nods and 22 wins .
But the ninth - season comedy was snubbed for the first time as a nominee for outstanding comedy series , as well as all acting categories .
Its only nomination : sound mixing .
Mandy Moore " This is Us " fans have another reason to bawl their eyes out : NBC 's hit drama took eight nominations , including best drama series and lead actor for both Sterling K. Brown and Milo Ventimiglia .
Missing from the list ?
Moore and co - star Chrissy Metz , a supporting - actress nominee last year .

" I 'm still recovering from watching ' America 's Next Top Justice , " Stephen Colbert confessed at the top of Tuesday 's " Late Show " episode , a day after the president named his choice for the Supreme Court seat being vacated by Anthony Kennedy . "
I had a little drinking game : I would pour myself a drink every time my glass was empty .
I won ! "
He continued , " Of course , the real winner was federal appeals court judge and cover model for ' Generic Dads Monthly , ' Brett Kavanaugh , which means I have Trump nomination Bingo !
See , it 's all squares that say ' white guy . '
I won .
And lost . " (
Though he admitted , " It 's not a hard game to play . " )
Colbert also admitted that he thinks the name Brett lacks the gravitas needed for a justice on the land 's highest court . "
That sounds less like a Supreme Court justice and more like a waiter at Ruby Tuesday 's , " he observed , before imagining Kananaugh greeting customers in a robe covered with pins . "
Hi , I 'm Brett , I 'll be your Supreme Court justice tonight !
Before you sit down , let me just clear away these rights for you . "
The comedian also wondered if Kavanaugh 's name had Trump thinking of someone else . "
His full name is Brett Michael Kanavaugh , so it is possible Trump thought he was nominating Poison lead singer and winner of ' Celebrity Apprentice , ' Brett Michaels .
At least we 'll know his stance on the landmark case of Nothing v. a Good Time . ' "

" Leave ' Em Laughing " is what stand - up comic Sebastian Maniscalco tries to do every time he takes the stage .
This morning , he goes one - on - one with our Mark Strassmann : Sebastian Maniscalco is exasperated , with everything . "
Taking a photo of yourself ?
What are you doing ?
What ... are ... you ... doing ? " "
I was brought up with a certain set of rules on how to behave .
And you look around today , everybody 's got their own set of rules .
Like , the basic courtesy in life I do n't think is there anymore and I think I point those things out in my act . " "
If you 're laughing you 're on board ; if you 're not , you 're the f * * * * * * problem , I 'm sorry ! "
That act is comic gold .
His latest tour is selling out theaters across the country .
In 2017 Forbes listed him as one of the top ten highest - paid comedians in the world .
At age 45 , Maniscalco has turned his personal gripes with everyday life into a career as one of standup comedy 's breakthrough performers . "
I went to my first Passover dinner .
The food they start bringing out ?
Oh God terrible !
Terrible food .
Celery , crackers , jam .
I 'm like , what is it ?
We 're losing people , people are leaving .
We need food ! "
His style is a unique blend of two of his early influences : the observational approach of Jerry Seinfeld , and the physicality of John Ritter .
Punchlines come alive in his pantomimes .
And at the heart of his humor is family ... in his case , a very colorful family .
He grew up in Chicago , the son of Rose , a school secretary , and Salvo , a hairdresser born in Sicily . "
As a small kid , I loved giving book reports and just getting in front of the class , but was never the class clown , " he said . "
And then going home and telling your family what happened at school today ? "
asked Strassmann . "
That sort of stage was the house .
And whenever I get around my family , it just seems that the comedy tends to write itself . "
Strassmann got a taste of that home - grown comedy at Maniscalco 's house in Los Angeles last year . "
These are a Sicilian cookie that my grandmother used to make called ... popocolovio ?
There 's many words in the Italian language that my father is still trying to find the English equivalent to .
Growing up we go , ' Dad , what does that mean in English ? ' '
He goes , ' Ahhhh ... it 's tough . ' "
Mark Strassmann visits with Sebastian Maniscalco 's family .
Food is present , naturally .
CBS News Joining them in the kitchen : Sebastian 's wife , artist Lana Gomez ; his sister , Jessica ; and , of course , his parents .
Jessica admitted taking part in a lot of " dad bashing , " and it still goes on . "
Man cave ?
You 're bragging about a man cave ?
My father had a man cave .
It was THE HOUSE ! "
Salvo Maniscalco , Sebastian 's father , is a seemingly inexhaustible font of material .
As Sebastian said , " Some of the material is so , like , verbatim out of his mouth .
I do n't even have to write it !
I just tell the story . " "
Keep , yeah , keep doin' it , " Salvo said . "
Yeah , just keep talking to me ! " " '
Dad , can we have a dog ? ' '
You want a dog ?
Three houses down , they have a dog .
You want to pet some fur ?
You pet the fur , you come back here , you cut the grass . '
What ? "
Strassmann said , " You do n't have to be Italian to appreciate the warmth of these stories . " "
Soon as you start talking about family , there 's an inherent relatability to what the people in the audience are watching .
And they 're like , Oh my God , my father !
That 's my dad !
That 's my wife !
They start relating to your own lives . "
Apparently , a lot of people are exasperated with their families .
Maniscalco has had three specials on Showtime .
And his memoir , " Stay Hungry , " tracks his life and career , which began when he moved to Los Angeles at age 24 .
He waited tables at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills .
During breaks , he 'd dash out to do a 15-minute set at the Comedy Club on Sunset Boulevard , and dash back to serve dessert .
Fifteen minutes paid $ 15 .
One day he waited on one of his comedic idols , Jerry Seinfeld . "
I just kind of scrapped the whole formality of the Four Seasons : ' Good afternoon , how are you ? '
It was more like , ' Hey , what 's going on ?
What do you guys want ? ' "
Gallery Books Fast - forward 15 years : Maniscalco was a guest in Seinfeld 's series , " Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee . " "
We 're driving around Los Angeles in a 1969 Camaro and , you know , he validated me as a comedian in his eyes . "
Strassmann asked , " Are you reminding people that it 's okay to laugh at yourself ? " "
Laugh at myself , laugh at others , and in a good - natured way , " he replied . "
It comes off as being friendly and loving , and I could not rip my father to shreds like I do onstage if I did n't love the man . "
So , what are we all getting all hopped up about ?
Just laugh ! "

A 91-year - old grandfather was reportedly told to " Go back to Mexico " before a woman and four men left him beaten and bloodied near the street in a Los Angeles - area neighborhood .
Rodolfo Rodriguez had left for his daily walk near his family 's home in Willowbrook on July 4 when he passed a small girl and a woman , the latter of whom attacked him with a concrete block without warning , he told CNN .
Soon after , a group of men attacked Rodriguez , too .
Misbel Borjas , a neighbor , witnessed the attack from her car , she told the Los Angeles Times .
She captured the incident on video shared with KTLA - TV , which shows Rodriguez with blood running down his face .
He was left unable to walk along with a broken cheek bone , bruised ribs and head injuries , the station reported . "
She was yelling at him , ' Go back to your country , or ' Go back to Mexico , " Borjas told the Times . "
It was racist . "
Rodriguez travels to the U.S. yearly from Michoacan , Mexico , to visit his family in Willowbrook , grandson Erik Mendoza told CNN , which reported that the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department was seeking up to five suspects -- the woman and three or four men -- as of Monday night .
Authorities said Rodriguez may have bumped into the girl , according to KTLA .
His grandson expressed shock to the station . "
How can you hurt a 92-year - old man ? "
said Mendoza , who told CNN that Rodriguez turns 92 this fall . "
What kind of threat does he pose to you , for you to do this to him ? "
A GoFundMe campaign established by Mendoza for his grandfather 's medical expenses has already blown way past its $ 15,000 goal , raising nearly $ 200,000 .
Rodriguez is now recovering at home , according to NBC Los Angeles , which reported from his bedside : More : Kids on winning robotics team told , ' Go back to Mexico ' More:'Go back to Mexico ' : Why so many racist chants at basketball games ?

Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images A slew of global developments are convening to threaten economic growth , according to one investment manager , who believes that the risks of a recession next year have now " significantly increased . "
Global growth stood at 3.8 percent in 2017 and it is set to add another 3.9 percent this year and the next , according to forecasts by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
But , the escalation of trade tensions , coupled with other factors , could reverse this trend , Beat Wittmann , a partner at financial consultancy Porta Advisors , told CNBCs " Squawk Box Europe . " "
I think the risk of a global recession in 2019 has significantly increased , " he said . "
We have normalization of monetary conditions , that s one thing , so we are in a late stage environment .
Then we have this escalation in tariffs and trade ... We have things like Brexit .
All of these things lead to losses of investment confidence and I mean real economic investment confidence , " Wiitman warned .
Central banks have started ending to their crisis - era accommodative policies , with the U.S. Federal Reserve , in particular , increasing interest rates -- which are set to translate into higher mortgage payouts and less available income for consumers .
At the same time , the U.S. has imposed new tariffs against global trade partners and these nations have retaliated .
The trade tensions are set to continue with Europe currently preparing for new duties on its cars .
IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde told CNBC last month that the trade tensions are the " biggest " risk for economic growth in the euro zone .
Most managers are worried because there s nowhere to hide .

A federal judge may decide this week to impose some kind of punishment against the Trump administration if he determines that it failed to meet his deadlines to reunite immigrant children separated from their parents .
Though the image of Attorney General Jeff Sessions or Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen being carted off to jail is unlikely , U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw does have several options to force the government to speed up the reunification process .
Legal experts said the judge could threaten contempt of court - and jail time - against lower - ranking members of federal agencies , could order hefty fines or order the agency heads to appear in court as a form of public shaming .
Stephen Yale - Loehr , an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School , said even those sanctions would be difficult to enforce because they would surely draw government appeals .
That 's why a more symbolic finding of contempt of court , without much punishment attached , may be the limit of Sabraw 's ruling . "
The court of public opinion , and the admonition by the judge , may be about as much as anyone can practically do at this point , " said Yale - Loehr , who signed onto an amicus brief against the government in a lawsuit .
Last month , Sabraw ordered the Trump administration to reunite nearly 3,000 children separated from their families , most under the president 's " zero tolerance " policy that went into full effect in May. Sabraw ordered that 63 children under age 5 be reunited by Tuesday night .
All other minors must be reunited by July 26 .
Department of Justice lawyers asked for an extension of Tuesday 's deadline .
They argued that several federal agencies mobilized as quickly as possible but face a daunting challenge that includes complicated cases .
During a court hearing Tuesday , Sabraw did n't budge , telling the government his deadlines were firm , not merely " aspirational goals . "
He asked an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who led the lawsuit to file suggestions for punishment , which Sabraw is likely to rule on during a court hearing Friday . "
Having that hanging over their heads is a great incentive to take a whole agency and move quickly , " said Ira Kurzban , a Miami - based immigration attorney who signed onto the amicus brief against the government .
Stephen Legomsky , a professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis , said the judge could threaten to jail lower - ranking officials who carried out the family separations or struggled to reunite the families .
Kurzban , Legomsky and other legal experts said such threats are highly unlikely , given the legal challenges they would prompt and the public spectacle they would create .
U.S. courts have long endorsed " sovereign immunity , " a legal principle that generally insulates government officials from lawsuits .
Congress has created some exceptions , but those are rare .
Alexander Stern , a California attorney who polled a half - dozen law professors on the possibility of jail time for Trump administration officials , said they all agreed that seeking jail time for Cabinet secretaries would distract from accomplishing the goal of reuniting all 3,000 families . "
Sessions is a very powerful man , " said Stern , founder of the legal research group Attorney IO . "
Trying to throw him in jail would be unprecedented .
You 'd have 40 percent of the country seeing that as a constitutional crisis .
If the judge sees a pathway to getting most of what he wants in a reasonable amount of time , I think he 'd choose that . "
Another option for Sabraw is to fine the government .
He could order a certain amount each day that it remains in violation of his order , or for each child that remains separated from the parent .
Though it may seem counterproductive for one arm of the government ( the judicial branch ) to receive money from another arm of the government ( the executive branch ) , there could be a way to use those fines to help the separated families .
Legomsky said there are legal procedures that allow a judge to direct money collected through fines to private groups assisting victims of a class - action lawsuit . "
The fund would have to be specifically earmarked for use in helping the reunified families recover from the trauma that the government has caused them , " he said .
The challenge facing Sabraw is that both of those options - jailing or fining federal officials - are incredibly rare .
Nicholas Parrillo , a Yale Law School professor , wrote a Harvard Law Review article in January on the history of contempt and had to go back to the 1950s to find examples of judges even threatening to imprison agency heads .
Although judges have imposed fines on federal agencies more recently , Parrillo found that the dispute was always resolved before any significant fines were paid . "
The rarity is partly because these kinds of sanctions run up against uncertainties about whether they 're legal and prudent against the federal government , but it 's also because public officials and government attorneys have considered it shameful to be found in contempt - sanction or no sanction - and they ve sought to head off that humiliation by working hard to convince the judge they re doing all they can to comply , " Parrillo said .
Another option for Sabraw is ordering the heads of government agencies to fly to San Diego and appear in his courtroom to explain the actions of their agencies .
Kurzban said that would only be symbolic but could work as a way of embarrassing the Trump administration and prompting it to reunify families faster . "
The point would be ( for Sabraw to say ) ' The buck stops with you , ' " Kurzban said .
A girl reacts as she tries an iPhone X at the Apple Omotesando store on November 3 , 2017 in Tokyo , Japan .
You can avoid this by spending two minutes and making sure your iPhone is automatically set to back up data to iCloud .
Here 's how .
A family friend recently lost her iPhone .
When she went to an Apple Store to buy a replacement , she was met with a surprise : There was n't a single backup of her earlier iPhones .
That meant all of her photos , text messages , apps , email settings were gone , permanently .
Now , when your iPhone is connected to Wi - Fi , is being charged and is locked , it 'll save an exact replica of your current phone to the cloud .
That means , if you happen to lose your iPhone and get a new one , you 'll only have to log in and select one of your backups to get right back where you were the moment your iPhone was lost .
Note that you get only 5 GB of free iCloud storage , which is enough for people who are n't storing that many pictures and messages in the cloud .
If you need more , like me , you can upgrade by going to Settings > iCloud > Change Storage Plan .
I pay $ 2.99 per month for 200 GB , which is reasonable .
A homeless man with no arms has been charged with stabbing a tourist in Florida .
Miami Beach police say 46-year - old Jonathan Crenshaw held a pair of scissors with his feet and stabbed 22-year - old Cesar Coronado just after midnight Tuesday , the Miami Herald reports .
Crenshaw is well - known in Miami Beach as a street artist who uses his feet to paint , according to local media .
Coronado was bleeding from his left arm when he was admitted to a local hospital , Reuters reports .
Crenshaw claimed he acted in self - defense after Coronado punched him in the head , the Herald reports .
Coronado , a tourist visiting from Chicago , and a friend told police that Coronado had only asked for directions before the alleged attack , the Miami New Times reports .
The publication has profiled Crenshaw in the past and found he has had multiple run - ins with police and other officials , including violent crime charges .
The New Times reports that Crenshaw 's most recent conviction was in 2014 , when he was sentenced to 180 days in jail for felony battery on a police officer .
The New Times says Crenshaw 's paintings are colorful mosaics that often featured eyes .
They sold for as much as $ 60 .
Crenshaw was booked for battery charges on Tuesday night and his bond was set at $ 7,500 , according to Miami - Dade Corrections .

A Louisiana man received a $ 10,000 fine for fatally shooting a black bear -- the state mammal -- while hunting in a wildlife area last fall .
Ronald J. Kimble told investigators he thought the four - year - old bear was a wild hog before fatally shooting her on the grounds of the Richard K. Yancey Wildlife Management Area last November , according to Baton Rouge 's WAFB - TV .
A " mortality signal " emitted from a radio collar placed around the black bear 's neck , the station reported , alerting a biologist with the state 's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries .
Agents traced the signal , discovering the deceased bear had been shot twice with a large caliber weapon .
The Louisiana black bear qualified as endangered in recent years , only coming off the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 's list in 2016 , Baton Rouge 's The Advocate noted .
Agents found Kimble in January hunting within an area the bear frequented , state wildlife officials said in an announcement .
When questioned , he admitted to killing the bear with a .270 rifle .
There is no hunting season for black bears in Louisiana .
Kimble was arrested for taking the bear during a closed season , plus another charge : possession of a firearm by a convicted felon .
The 30-year - old from Lettsworth , Louisiana , was later ordered by Judge John Herke to pay $ 10,000 in assessed restitution plus $ 250 in attorney fees , New Orleans ' WGNO - TV reported , and his hunting and fishing licenses were revoked .
The licenses can be restored once Kimble pays the full amount , according to The Advocate .

A monitor displays Procter & Gamble Co. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) in New York , U.S. , on Monday , May 15 , 2017 .
Procter & Gamble 's profitability will suffer because of rising commodity costs , according to Jefferies .
The firm lowered its rating for Procter & Gamble shares to hold from buy , predicting the company will report earnings below expectations next fiscal year .
Analyst Kevin Grundy cited a number of factors weighing on the consumer product giant , including slowing market growth , emerging market volatility , U.S. retail difficulties , a stronger U.S. dollar and pricing challenges that " should drive estimates lower again at P&G. " His note on Monday was titled " Tide Unlikely to Turn : Downgrade to Hold as Bull Thesis Wanes . "
Grundy lowered his price target to $ 79 from $ 83 for Procter & Gamble shares .
The new target is roughly even with Fridays closing price .
The analyst noted a price basket of P&G key commodities costs has risen by about 15 percent over the past year .
He said the company does nt have the ability to pass through higher costs to consumers . "
Commodities [ are ] a significant headwind , " he said . "
P&G is expected to report its first year of negative pricing in well over a decade as the pricing environment has clearly become more difficult . "
As a result of gross profit margin pressure , Grundy reduced his fiscal year 2019 earnings per share estimate for the company to $ 4.25 from $ 4.52 versus the Wall Street consensus of $ 4.43 . "
P&G ( as well as other companies in our coverage ) does not expect EMs or category growth rates to materially improve in the near - to- intermediate term , " he said . "
In addition , competitive dynamics , particularly in P&Gs Baby and Grooming businesses ( combined ~30 % of global profits ) will likely remain difficult . "
Procter & Gamble shares are underperforming the market this year .
The stock declined 14 percent year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500 's 3 percent gain .
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

By Bernstein 's count , 15 companies account for 80 percent of the world 's oil reserves , and only two of them -- Exxon and BP -- are showing improvement in this area .
Bernstein is part of a chorus of oil market watchers , including OPEC and the International Energy Agency , warning that companies are underinvesting in the type of big , long - cycle projects that yield huge payloads of crude .
These projects tend to be carried out by oil majors like Exxon Mobil and Chevron , but fell out of fashion during a prolonged crude price slump .
Oil prices could top all - time highs near $ 150 a barrel because energy companies are investing too little money in new production , Bernstein Research said Friday . "
The risk for the oil industry in reducing investment today , is creating a shortfall in oil supply tomorrow .
Oil remains an essential part of our lives , " Bernstein said in a research note on Friday . "
Any shortfall in supply will result in a super - spike in prices , potentially much larger than the US$ 150 / bbl spike witnessed in 2008 . "
International benchmark Brent crude and U.S. crude hit their highest - ever levels just above $ 147 a barrel in July 2008 .
Prices are currently trading in the $ 70-$80 per barrel range .
The industry 's reinvestment ratio , which measures cash flow against investment in oil and gas exploration and production , is the lowest in a generation , according to Bernstein .
Meanwhile , the amount of time that big oil companies ' reserves will last has fallen by 30 percent since 2000 .
If they do nothing to replenish their reserves , they will last for 10 years .
That compares with 15 years of coverage in 2000 .
The producers that let their proven oil reserve life fall below 10 years " will struggle to grow production " without purchasing other oil companies , in Bernstein 's view . "
At some point the proverbial ' chickens will come home to roost ' .
The impact will be production declines and another super - cycle in oil prices , " Bernstein analysts concluded .
Bernstein acknowledges that oil industry executives face considerable uncertainty about when crude demand will peak , given the rise of renewable energy and the popularity of electric vehicles .
If demand peaks before 2030 , pulling back investment in new production will pay off .
But if oil consumption is still growing at that point , CEOs will look " foolish , " Bernstein said .
Investors currently calling on exploration and production companies to return more cash to shareholders at the expense of funding future production may also come to regret their strategy , Bernstein added .
A new survey shows that more female executives plan to give themselves a raise next year .
That 's good news not just for them but for American working women generally , argues the president of the Women 's Presidents Organization and the founder of EY Entrepreneurial Winning Women , since it could help in the long - term fight for . "
One important part of closing the gap starts with those lucky enough to set their own salaries , " Marsha Firestone and Lisa Schiffman write in the Harvard Business Review . "
What women in this category accomplish matters not only to them but also to our entire economy . "
EY 's Entrepreneurial Winning Women program worked with WPO -- which includes thousands of female presidents , CEOs and directors of privately held multimillion - dollar companies -- to release its annual Business Outlook Survey .
After surveying 413 WPO members , the organization finds that over 47 percent of women expect to give themselves a raise of 1 to 20 percent , while just over 5 percent of women plan to give themselves a raise of 20 percent or more . "
Whether its a reflection of robust economic growth , a redefinition of their own worth , or both , this change is very good news , " Firestone and Schiffman write . "
It suggests more female founders are ready to put themselves on even footing with their male counterparts , at least when it comes to measuring their own worth . "
Although data show that U.S. women working full - time earned just $ 0.80 for every dollar earned by men in 2016 -- and that gap only widens for women of color -- nearly 40 percent of men are skeptical about whether a wage gap really exists .
Warren Buffett is among the over 60 percent of U.S. men who trust the facts .
He has become a prominent supporter of closing the gender wage gap and earlier this year he said that men have a role to play in making sure women advance in their careers , in business and the economy .
Other studies have found that women have a role to play , too , since even female founders are hesitant to pay themselves as much as their male counterparts do .
The new survey results make Firestone and Schiffman hopeful that that could finally change . "
Its hard to say with absolute precision that female entrepreneurs are now earning and paying themselves in ways that are comparable to men , " Firestone and Schiffman write . "
But the new data from the survey suggests that they re definitely in the ballpark , and the fact that they re planning to pay themselves more is a good sign . "
While the Business Outlook Survey is nt an exhaustive study on female executives across the U.S. , the authors say the survey result " represents a hopeful indicator . "
They also pointed to the fact that women - owned businesses have nearly tripled from 4 million 30 years ago to more than 11 million today . "
When the women running these companies set higher salaries for themselves , it sends a signal not only to investors but to everyone -- including themselves -- of what they re worth , " Firestone and Schiffman write .

A precipitous drop in industrial metal prices over the past month could be flashing a bullish sign for bonds .
That s based on the findings of John Lonski , head of capital markets research at Moodys Analytics , who says the swoon in industrial metals could be a boon for bondholders as the Treasurys market has historically taken a cue from metals prices .
Bond yields tend to fall when industrial metals come under pressure , but are slower to rise when metal values see an uptick .
Debt prices rise when yields fall . "
As the yearly decline by the industrial metals price index deepens , the likelihood of an accompanying drop by the 10-year Treasury yield increase appreciably , " he said .
Lonski says that since 1987 , there were 49 quarters when the three - month average for the Moodys industrial metal prices index fell from a year earlier .
Eighty six percent of those quarterly periods also saw a similar fall in the 10-year yield from a year earlier .
Moodys index for base metal prices fell 12.2 % in the past month , hitting its lowest level since last August .
Over the same period , the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.434 % has shed 15 basis points to 2.834 % , according to Tradeweb data .
Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields .
The plunge in metal prices have arrested their cyclical climb Moodys It should nt be a surprise that bond yields follow industrial commodities as both are governed by the dynamics of global growth .
When the world economy is booming , appetite for raw materials among manufacturers and builders will push prices for commodities higher .
In the three decades up to 2017 , the percent change in Moodys industrial metals price index showed a positive correlation of 0.79 with the International Monetary Funds estimate of global growth , according to Lonski .
A positive reading of 1.0 would be a perfect correlation , meaning the two move in the same direction .
At the same time , strong growth can spur inflation , which can wear away at the value of a bonds fixed - interest payments , sending yields for U.S. debt higher .
Yet despite the fall in metal prices , inflation has been on the rise .
The consumer price index accelerated to a 2.9 % year - to - year pace in June .
Market participants , however , expect the burst of price pressures to be temporary , with many seeing the lack of wage pressures and a potential trade war weighing on inflation .
See : Why is the bond market shrugging off a six - year high in inflation ?
Lonskis finding that bond yields share a close relationship with metal prices is nt new to investors .
This correlation has been used more famously by bond guru Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital who said the 10-year U.S. government bond yield closely tracks the ratio between copper and gold prices , which has fallen over the past month .
Much of the drop in the copper - to - gold ratio has been driven by the slump in copper values .
September copper futures US : HGU8 have tumbled 15 % in the past month .
Analysts say the weakness in the ubiquitous metal shows investors may be turning their back on the narrative of global synchronized growth which enjoyed a surge of popularity earlier this year . "
It has to be asked what it says about the global economic outlook when this cyclically - sensitive metal has collapsed , " said David Rosenberg , chief economist for Gluskin Sheff , in a note .

A second suspect has been arrested in the June 18 shooting death of Florida rapper XXXTentacion .
On Wednesday , the Broward County Sheriff 's Office announced that Michael Boatwright , 22 , is in police custody , along with Dedrick Williams , who was arrested June 20 and charged with first - degree murder .
In the press release , investigators said that Boatwright was actually arrested on unrelated drug charges last week and was served with an additional arrest warrant in the XXXTentacion case on Tuesday .
He now faces an additional charge of first - degree murder .
They believe he was one of the two armed suspects who confronted the rapper , whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy , in an apparent robbery outside RIVA Motorsports in Deerfield Beach , Fla. , on June 18 .
The 20-year - old rising star was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital later that afternoon .
They are still attempting to locate and question Robert Allen , who was labeled a person of interest in the case last week .
The press release also noted there is also a felony arrest warrant out on him for violation of probation for drug possession and carrying a concealed firearm .
A shopper carries an Insignia Roku TV television at a Best Buy Co. store in Louisville , Kentucky , U.S. , Roku stock is primed for a comeback as the online streaming platform starts to leverage its role as a leading over - the - top television provider , Oppenheimer says .
Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein on Monday upgraded shares of the Los Gatos , California - based pay TV company to outperform from perform , advising clients that the company 's homegrown Roku Channel will likely help add to its roughly 21 million customers in the U.S. and capture $ 19 billion in revenue potential .
The company , which continues to offer an easy way to access the top streaming services like rivals Apple TV and Chromecast , launched its own channel for users of Roku streaming players last fall , connecting customers to hundreds of movies and some TV shows they can stream for free .
The Roku Channel includes content it licenses directly from film and television studios as well as content compiled from publishers , pitting the company against streaming giant Netflix . "
The rapid adoption of The Roku Channel gives us incremental confidence in the channel 's ability to garner viewership on other platforms , such as Samsung , allowing Roku to monetize a broader portion of the OTT ecosystem than we had previously assumed was possible , " Helfstein wrote .
Roku should be able to wield " its advantages in pricing and merchandising to remain the market leader in consumer - facing connected television solutions . "
Roku shares rose 5.2 percent Tuesday following the Oppenheimer note .
The company 's stock is down roughly 16 percent in 2018 through Monday versus the S&P 500 's 1.1 percent return .
Helfstein set a price target of $ 50 on Roku shares , implying 15.5 percent upside over the next 12 to 18 months .
Much of that upside , he wrote , will come from the companys ability to drive video advertising revenue , which could total as much as $ 19 billion given its expected market share .
The stock went public last September at $ 14 a share . "
Rokus business today is generating users for the Roku platform , either on a Roku Player or the Smart TV Roku OS , and monetizing its partners content , either by taking a share of subscription video on demand / advertising video on demand revenue or selling subscription video on demand advertisements itself and sharing the revenue with its partners , " the analyst added .

A tree ignites as firefighters attempt to stop flames from the Pawnee fire from jumping across highway 20 near Clearlake Oaks , California on July 1 , 2018 .
There 's no relief in sight for stubborn wildfires flaring all over the Western U.S. , including one that began Saturday in northern California that forced the evacuation of hundreds of people northwest of Sacramento .
The National Weather Service also warned Monday in a tweet about a " very dangerous heat wave with elevated to potentially critical fire weather conditions " that is forecast later this week and into the weekend in portions of southern and central California .
It forecast triple - digit temperatures in several areas on Friday and Saturday across several California counties , including portions of Los Angeles .
Heading into the Fourth of July holiday , authorities are preparing for even greater risk of wildfires due to illegal fireworks or campfires .
Several fire agencies across the Western U.S. plan to have extra equipment and crews on standby through the holiday to quickly respond to wildfires .
Also , several cities and counties have banned personal fireworks due to the increased fire danger , including Mesa County , Colorado , where fines for violations can run up to $ 1,000 and result in a felony charge . "
Nationally , nearly nine out of 10 wildfires are human - caused , and fireworks definitely play a role in the number of human - caused wildfires , " said Jennifer Jones , a spokesperson for the U.S. Forest Service .
She said firefighters are well aware of " the potential for wildfires as the forecast indicates continued hot dry weather across the region , and people will be recreating on public lands during the Independence Day holiday .
The Forest Service is working with its interagency partners to be prepared for potential increases in the fire activity by strategically staging smokejumpers , engines , crews and equipment to reduce response time . "
As of Monday , about 60 wildfires burned throughout the U.S. on more than 504,000 acres of federal , state and private land , according to the National Interagency Fire Center .
That is up about 25 percent in terms of acreage from a year ago .
In California , at least 10 wildfires are burning throughout the state . "
Right now we 're over 300 fires more than we had at this time last year in California , " said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Lucas Spellman . "
We just did n't stop from last year , when we even had big fires in December . "
Last December 's Thomas fire in southern California scorched more than 281,000 acres , a record for the state .
The largest blaze at present in the Golden State is the so - called County fire that began Saturday and as of Monday afternoon had exploded to 60,000 acres , according to Cal Fire .
More than 2,115 crews are battling the blaze in three counties , Yolo , Napa and Lake , all now back in drought conditions .
The fast - moving County fire , fueled primarily by tall grass and brush , was 5 percent contained as of Monday afternoon .
There 's also the nearly 15,000-acre Pawnee fire burning about 40 miles away in Lake County .
It started June 23 and so far has destroyed 22 structures and threatens 50 structures .
As of Monday , Pawnee was 75 percent contained . "
More land has already burned in California in the first six months of this year than during the same period last year , " California Gov. Jerry Brown said in a release late Monday . "
Cal Fire has already fought more than 53,000 acres of wildfire this year compared to an average of 23,000 acres over the same time in previous years .
Brown also issued a statement with legislative leaders on the formation of a wildlife preparedness and response conference committee and plans to amend legislation to " help prepare the state to deal with the increasingly extreme weather and natural disasters caused by climate change . "
Meantime , at least eight wildfires are burning across Colorado and six in Utah .
Crews also are battling blazes in eastern Washington and southwest Oregon .
One of the largest wildfires burning in the West is the Spring Creek fire in southern Colorado , which has charred more than 56,000 acres and as of Monday morning was 5 percent contained .
Authorities believe the blaze was human - caused and Saturday announced on Facebook a Danish man had been arrested and was being held on arson charges .
The so - called 416 fire outside Durango , Colorado , has burned more than 49,000 acres .
It started June 1 and was 37 percent contained as of Monday .
So far this year , a total of 29,111 wildfires have burned a total of 2,534,701 acres of federal , state and private land nationwide , according to the NIFC .
That exceeds the 10-year average number of acres of 2,285,234 burned by this date but lags in the number of fires .
Fire experts see continued danger of major wildfires throughout the summer due to heat , dry conditions and millions of dead trees that provide added fuel for large blazes .
In California alone , the Forest Service estimates there are about 129 million dead trees on nearly 9 million acres of land .
Most of the dead trees are in the central and southern Sierra Nevada region of California , and insect attacks and drought are to blame for the high numbers .

A website that allows students to review their college professors has dropped a long - standing " chili - pepper " rating from its site after facing criticism on social media that the rating was used to objectify professors , particularly women .
RateMyProfessors.com tweeted on June 28 that the rating system was removed from the site , but said that the rating was meant to " reflect a dynamic / exciting teaching style . "
However , the rating was commonly associated with physical attractiveness .
In 2014 , RateMyProfessors.com made an April Fool 's Day joke out of the chili pepper rating , satirically launching " Date My Professors . "
RateMyProfessors ' tweet announcing the removal of the chili pepper was sent in reply to BethAnn McLaughlin , a Vanderbilt University professor , according to BuzzFeed .
She criticized the rating as " obnoxious and utterly irrelevant to our teaching . "
Her tweet gained over 15,000 likes and was retweeted thousands of times .
McLaughlin told the publication that she 's heard from both male and female professors who felt the rating was detrimental . "
Telling students that evaluating professors based on their looks has aged poorly .
In the age of # MeToo , # TimesUp and # MeTooSTEM , we know better , so we must do better , " McLaughlin wrote in an article on edgeforscholars.org .
Some academics have criticized the effort to remove the rating .
A report on Poynter.org documented an exchange between McLaughlin and a male professor who said he was " proud of that rating , " calling it an " innocuous thing . "
A woman accused Jacksonville Jaguars defensive tackle Marcell Dareus of sexual assault and giving her a sexually transmitted disease , according to a lawsuit filed in a Florida court .

court records , Dareus has not been charged with any crimes .
A spokesman for Houston police told USA TODAY Sports that there was no indication that officers responded to the hotel on the dates spelled out in the lawsuit and added he would be unable to confirm whether Dareus is even under investigation under Texas privacy laws . "
There are civil and criminal laws in both Florida and Texas that address circumstances where someone knowingly exposes another to sexually transmitted diseases , " Caj Boatright , one of woman 's attorneys , said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports . "
As of now , we are not aware that any criminal charges have been filed in this matter .
Our focus is on protecting our clients right to recover damages for the severe physical and emotional harm that 's been caused to her . "

Acxiom is nearing a deal to sell its marketing solutions division to Interpublic Group for around $ 2.2 billion , a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday .
The move means that Little Rock , Arkansas - based Acxiom will part ways with a business that comprises roughly three quarters of its revenue in order to double down on its fast - growing " LiveRamp " unit , which helps companies more easily access and manipulate data .
The talks are advanced and a deal could be announced as soon as next week , though there is always a chance that discussions could stall at the last minute , the person added .
After the deal closes , Acxiom will eventually explore a potential sale of its remaining business , though its board may choose to give the Acxiom some time to trade in the public markets before they run a sale process , the person said .

Advertising legend John Hegarty has had more than six decades worth of experience working with major brands , however , his career may have looked a lot different if he had nt taken on some valuable advice early on in life .
During his time at design school in the 1960s , Hegarty became enthralled by advertising and the creativity that was spawned out of it .
Having decided to create an advertising portfolio in order to secure a job -- luckily he received two offers , but had to decide which one was the better option . "
I was offered two jobs and one of them was at Y&R , and the other was at Benton & Bowles , and I said to a friend of mine : ' Which one should I take ?
And I said : ' You know , the Benton & Bowles one is paying half of what the Y&R job is , " Hegarty , creative founder of Bartle Bogle Hegarty ( BBH ) , told CNBCs Karen Tso on an episode of " What Drives You . " "
So the friend of mine said : ' John , the thing is that Benton & Bowles has got this new brilliant New York art director coming over , that 's going to be an opportunity , I 'd go there .
So I went to Benton & Bowles . " "
So the first lesson I learned was : Do n't chase the money , chase the opportunity . "

After NASA scientists announced they found the " building blocks " for life on Mars in June , some researchers suggest the organic molecules might have actually been found over 40 years ago -- and NASA spacecrafts accidentally burned them .
Viking landers sent to Mars in 1976 to search for organic matter reported finding nothing , a conclusion that shocked scientists at the time .
New research published in the Journal of Geophysical Research Planets , suggests the Vikings ' main instrument might have actually discovered the organic matter but burned it while collecting soil samples .
The primary instrument on the Viking landers , a gas chromatograph - mass spectrometer , used heat to try and find these molecules .
That was big a mistake .
Because of a now - known chemical in the soil perchlorate , the landers would have destroyed any organics in the process .
NASA 's Phoenix lander found perchlorate on Mars after it 's 2007 launch .
Chris McKay , a planetary scientist at NASA 's Ames Research Center involved in the research , told USA TODAY perchlorate is also a component in solid rocket fuel . "
If the perchlorate concentration is high enough it will create an explosion , " he said .
On Mars , the perchlorate concentration is low ( only half of one percent ) , meaning no explosion , but still enough heat to destroy organics , he said .
The bad news , McKay said , is that all missions to Mars have tried to find organics using this heat method . "
We now realize that this is not going to work on Mars ... So we are working on methods to analyze organics by adding acid to the soil and never heating it up , " he said .

Triple Crown winner Justify will not run the betfair.com Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on July 29 .
And it appears the sport 's latest superstar 's racing career may be in jeopardy after a report surfaced Tuesday about a minor injury .
According to the Blood - Horse , Justify is being evaluated for some filling in his left front ankle , thus putting his training on hold .
` ` To go from a maiden winner in February to an undefeated Triple Crown winner in June has been an incredible ride , ' ' said Elliott Walden , WinStar Farm 's president , CEO , and racing manager .
` ` He is too special to the owners , our team , and all the fans he has around the world to not be 100 percent healthy .
As far as any future plans for him , they will be decided after we get him checked out .
He is an amazing horse , and we are blessed by his presence . ' '
Justify , stabled at Santa Anita in California , has not worked out since winning the Belmont Stakes just over four weeks ago .
Trainer Bob Baffert , who has won the Haskell eight times , had indicated that the Haskell was one of the targets for Justify 's next race , although that began to look increasingly unlikely as his inactivity continued .
Without Justify , can Monmouth Park save the Haskell ?
` ` Justify had some filling in his left front ankle a week ago , which subsided in a couple days , " Baffert said .
` ` I trained him last week and the filling came back .
We want to get him checked out . ' '
Contenders for Monmouth Park 's Haskell Monmouth Park officials had hoped to host a second Triple Crown winner in three years .
American Pharoah , the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years , ran in the 2015 Haskell , with a record crowd of 60,983 showing up at the Oceanport racetrack .
` ` We still have a Grade 1 race and we expect to have a lot of really good horses running , ' ' said Dennis Drazin , president and CEO of Darvy Development , which operates Monmouth Park .
Some of the potential Haskell entrants right now include : Kentucky Derby runner - up Good Magic ; Preakness runner - up Bravazo ; Ohio Derby winner Core Beliefs ; Lone Sailor , second in the Ohio Derby and fifth in the Preakness ; and My Boy Jack , fifth in the Kentucky Derby .

Alaskas last two Blockbuster stores -- community gathering spots and nostalgic tourist attractions that got a big plug from HBOs John Oliver -- are shuttering .
That leaves just one of the once ubiquitous video rental hub open in the entire U.S. The franchises in Anchorage and Fairbanks will close for rentals after Sunday night and reopen Tuesday for video liquidation sales through the end of August , said Kevin Daymude , general manager of Blockbuster Alaska , according to the Associated Press .
The closings were confirmed in a post on Blockbuster Alaskas Facebook page .
The news magazine program CBS Sunday Morning in 2017 aired a feature on the significance of the community gathering place that these Blockbusters offered in Alaska , where movie nights and other events supplemented rentals .
Their existence , long after the dinosaur retail chain was extinct in much of the U.S. , was prolonged by relatively strong customer demand .
That s because the fast internet service needed for streaming entertainment , such as Netflix NFLX , -3.76 % , comes at a hefty premium in Alaska compared to the lower 48 .
Even with the unique demand , business is nt strong enough to go on .
Read : Netflix earnings will be all about subscriber additions , especially overseas The Alaska stores did go down fighting , however .
The closures come just two months after the host of HBOs " Last Week Tonight with John Oliver " sent a jockstrap worn by Russell Crowe in the 2005 movie " Cinderella Man " and other items to the Anchorage store , which displayed them in an effort to drive more traffic . "
You would not believe how much business we got just from that memorabilia alone , " Daymude told the AP . "
I ca nt thank John Oliver or his show enough . "
The first Blockbuster video rental store in the U.S. opened in 1985 , and at its peak the company had about 9,000 stores worldwide .
In its heyday , Blockbuster had 15 stores in Alaska , Daymude said .
Some stores in more remote , less populated parts of the state began closing in the early 2000s as most Blockbuster stores began to vanish across the U.S. The corporation filed for bankruptcy in 2010 .

ALBANY -- Count Cynthia Nixon among the left - leaning politicians who identify with democratic socialism .
Nixon , the former Sex and the City star from Manhattan challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a Democratic primary , issued a statement to Politico this week confirming her support for the political philosophy , saying it aligns with many of her long - held policy positions .
Her public support for democratic socialism comes after endorsing Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez , a self - described socialist , ahead of the Bronx Democrat 's surprise June 26 primary victory over longtime Queens Rep. Joe Crowley . "
Some more establishment , corporate Democrats get very scared by this term but if democratic socialism means that you believe health care , housing , education and the things we need to thrive should be a basic right not a privilege , then count me in , " Nixon said in the statement .
More : Andrew Cuomo has a huge lead over Cynthia Nixon , especially in the suburbs Nixon 's support for the philosophy comes as she runs a Democratic primary campaign from Cuomo 's left , positioning herself as a more - liberal alternative to the two - term incumbent .
New York 's state - level primary is Sept. 13 this year .
Democratic socialism was popularized in recent years by Bernie Sanders , who promoted the platform during his 2016 run in the Democratic presidential primary against Hillary Clinton .
Nixon backed Clinton in that race but has since been endorsed by Our Revolution , the political - organizing group that sprung from Sanders ' campaign .
In her statement , Nixon pointed to her support for several issues that align with those favored by democratic socialists , including Medicare for all , higher taxes on the wealthy and refusing to accept corporate donations . "
As Martin Luther King put it , call it democracy or call it democratic socialism , but we have to have a better distribution of wealth in this country , " she said .
A Cuomo campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro , the Republican candidate for governor , called on Cuomo to reject democratic socialism . "
Andrew Cuomo has been playing follow the leader with self - proclaimed socialist Cynthia Nixon , and it 's time he took a stand , " Molinaro said in a statement .

ALBANY -- This is not the way to get awakened in bed .
A New York man -- admittedly panicked , authorities said -- called police last month after a large snake fell from the ceiling and into his bed as he slept .
Officers from the state Department of Environmental Conservation responded to the call in the village of Pulaski , Oswego County .
The call came in that the snake fell from an apartment above the man 's bedroom , the DEC said Wednesday .

Then it fell through the roof .
The snake is legal to possess in New York .
So it was reunited with its owner , the DEC said .
But not before it make its nightmarish entrance into the apartment below it .

Alexandra Van Houtte , right , with her co - workers Margaux Warin , left , and Hugo Bassani at the Tagwalk office in Paris , June 27 , 2018 .
Four years ago , Alexandra Van Houtte was a fashion assistant in Paris .
She would sit in the back offices of magazines like Grazia , Glamour or international editions of Vogue for countless hours researching and cataloging looks for fashion shoots .
The monotony and inefficiency of scrolling for a particular look through sites like Style.com or Womens Wear Daily -- a chore undertaken by generations of junior assistants and stylists across the globe -- got her thinking about how it could be made better . "
For a multibillion - dollar industry that prided itself on being forward thinking , the whole system was totally hopeless , " said Ms. Van Houtte , 29 , who studied Mandarin at college in Britain before starting her career in fashion .
Read more from The New York Times : Luxurys chess masters prepare for a new game Chanel publishes annual results for first time in 108 Years Bottega Veneta names Daniel Lee as creative director At the time , start - ups like WhatsApp , Uber and Deliveroo were upending the landscape of their respective sectors , transforming the way people communicate , shop , socialize , travel and eat .
When , Ms. Van Houtte wondered , would it be fashions turn to develop a transformative platform to make the lives of those doing her job easier ?
A service that could even reach fashion - conscious women outside the industry .
In May 2015 , with no answer forthcoming , she decided to build it for herself , funding the venture initially by putting her flat on Airbnb .
Tagwalk , which calls itself the worlds first fashion search engine , is the result .
By using more than 2,800 key words , users can search by brand , season , city , trend , color , fabric or style through 128,000 pictures . "
Even if you are the best buyer or trend searcher in town , no one can have an immediate recall on that much content , " she said from her bright Paris headquarters in the Second Arrondissement , where she leads a team of 14 . "
Now , if you remember that Prada used neon last season and want to see who else did for a mood board , you can do it fast and with just a few clicks of your mouse . "
Le Figaro and The Financial Times have called Tagwalk the Google of fashion .
But when she started out , Ms. Van Houtte , who initially tagged every single image by hand ( now it is mostly done via artificial intelligence algorithms , though still given a human once - over before going live ) , encountered considerable skepticism , particularly from potential investors . "
A lot of them were very dismissive , " she said . "
They said it was too niche , that it only catered to bloggers and assistants and lower rungs of the fashion industry , that it could nt scale .
Even my parents started having their doubts about where the business could go . "
Critically , one person did not .
Carmen Busquets , the Venezuelan businesswoman and angel investor who found fame as a founding investor in Net - a - Porter , quickly understood Tagwalks potential .
She put seed funding into the business when it was just two months old . "
Investing early on in disruptive ideas is always a big risk , but its one I ve taken many times because you become a co - founder and partner as well as an investor , " said Ms. Busquets , who later introduced Ms. Van Houtte to a secondary major investor , Adrian Cheng of C Ventures . "
Alexandras business plan immediately made sense to me , " Ms. Busquets said .
The business does not have a subscription fee , nor does it have advertising .
It generates cash from its roughly 25,000 users ( who use the site roughly three times a week ) in four ways .
There is a consulting arm for brands on digital and social media growth , and a fast - growing shopping component that allows for purchase of featured looks via affiliated links .
More meaningful , however , is that smaller labels or those without runway shows can pay a monthly rate to be featured on the database alongside bigger houses , thus thrown into the sightlines of busy editors and stylists .
Emerging labels pay around 150 euros ( about $ 175 ) , while more established brands pay 450 euros ( $ 520 ) . "
Within a week of being on Tagwalk , I was getting editorial requests from a different level of industry power player , those inside a bubble that had been so hard to crack before , " said Rosh Mahtani , the founder of Alighieri , a jewelry label sold on Net - a - Porter . "
But the really valuable part of the partnership is data .
Insight into what trends people are looking at on Tagwalk , or key words that are consistently popular , has helped me shape my next creative and commercial steps , from how many pieces to produce to what kinds of stones or materials to use . "
For Tagwalk , mining and selling data analytics is where the real money is .
Though the user base is still relatively small , the influence of those who regularly visit the site is big , making access to their behavioral habits extremely valuable to those who want to better understand them .
Nearly all of the biggest brands in the industry are keen to know which shows got the most searches for the fall 2018 season .
According to Tagwalk , the top three in New York were Calvin Klein , Phillip Lim and Bottega Veneta , while in London it was JW Anderson , Erdem and Christopher Kane .
In Milan , Gucci ran ahead of the competition ( followed by Dolce & Gabbana and Prada ) ; in Paris , Dior came in ahead ( barely ) of Chanel , then Saint Laurent . "
We can immediately see , and tell a brand , which looks are the most searched for , by whom and in which countries , as well as how a brands collection has fared compared to other brands overall , " Ms. Van Houtte said . "
We think its a simple idea but with revolutionary potential , " she added with a grin .
Alicia Shepard Opinion contributor President Donald Trump can be infuriating .
Whether you love or hate him , few would disagree he s brilliant at getting under peoples skin .
He s like the sibling who knows exactly how to push your buttons and makes you do something you instantly regret .
The latest casualty of Trump - baiting is two journalists who could nt help themselves -- even though they know better -- from lashing out at the president after five staffers at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis were killed in their newsroom last month .
Trump is a master at baiting any one person or group he thinks gets in his way by using dismissive name calling that invariably sticks .
And he has a particular fondness for attacking the media .
Nicknames for rivals The presidents knack for nasty nicknames got national attention during the 2016 primary when he came up with derogatory , memorable names for Republican opponents .
There was " Low energy Jeb " and " Little Marco . "
Sen. Ted Cruz was dismissed as " Lyin Ted . "
Then he moved on to the Democrats . "
Crazy Bernie . " "
Cryin Chuck ( Schumer ) . " "
Pocahontas " for Sen. Elizabeth Warren .
His anti - Hillary Clinton rhetoric reached millions during the endless hours of free air time during the campaign .
Who can forget " Crooked Hillary " or " Lyin Hillary " -- nicknames Trump repeated so often they are permanently drummed into our brains .
The constant denigration may have figured into why Clinton foolishly said something she instantly regretted and may even have hurt her chances of winning .
In September 2016 , she told donors that half of Trumps supporters belong in a " basket of deplorables , " because they are " racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamaphobic . "
No one is immune from Trumps taunting .
The media get it in spades .
There s nary a news consumer who ca nt repeat without a seconds thought the presidents media descriptors .
We are : " lying , " " failing , " " dishonest , " " fake news , " " crooked , " " corrupt , " " bad people " and the most untrue , " enemy of the people . "
One wrong tweet The taunting fires up supporters .
But it also gets to hard - working , committed journalists -- even though it should not .
It got to Reuters breaking news editor Rob Cox on June 28 after he heard that five staffers had been murdered inside their Annapolis newsroom .
Cox concluded Trump - fueled hatred of the media had motivated the mass shooter .
He reacted like a school yard kid who snapped after months of being tormented . "
This is what happens when @real DonaldTrump calls journalists the enemy of the people , " Cox tweeted . "
Blood is on your hands , Mr. President .
Save your thoughts and prayers for your empty soul . "
While reporters routinely cover shootings at schools and public venues , the murder of colleagues at a community paper -- the kind many started on -- was deeply personal .
Cox did what he should not have done .
He showed his hand .
He shared his anger at a president who relentlessly spews anti - media rhetoric .
He violated the tenet that journalists should maintain freedom from bias .
Reuters rebuked him publicly , apologizing for Coxs tweet , saying it was inconsistent with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles .

Journalists are people too , with all the rights of citizens , " according to Reuters basic principles . "
If we want to tweet or post about a school play , a film or a favorite recipe , we are free to do so .
When dealing with matters of public importance and actual or potential subjects of coverage , however , Reuters journalists should be mindful of the impact their publicly expressed opinions can have on their work and on Reuters . "
Cox deleted the tweet and apologized ina series of four tweets . "
When I saw the news today that a mass shooter had targeted the employees of a news in Maryland I responded emotionally and inappropriately , " Cox tweeted . "
Though my comments were entirely personal , they were not in keeping with the Reuters Trust Principles and my own standard for letting facts , not snap judgments , guide my understanding .
My experience as a member of the community of Newtown , Connecticut in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook tragedy , combined with the possibility that my colleagues in the press were being targeted , pushed me into a state of emotional distress . "
Cynicism fueled Connor Berry , a reporter at the Republican in Springfield , Mass. He tweeted a picture of Trumps red " Make America Great Again " hat , suggesting the shooter had dropped one on the newsroom floor .
He had nt .
As it turned out , the gunman shot up the newsroom to avenge a long - standing grudge against the paper , and it had nothing to do with Trumps relentless media bashing .
Berrys tweet cost him his job . "
Folks , my 21-year career as a ' journalist , ' a fancy term that makes my skin crawl , frankly , came to a screeching halt yesterday with one stupid , regrettable tweet , " Berry tweeted after resigning . "
Ca nt take it back ; wish I could .
My sincere apologies to all good , hardworking reporters and POTUS supporters . "
Other journalists , too , have lost their job or been reassigned after impetuously hitting send on a tweet that revealed their biases .
Newsrooms continually warn reporters to keep their personal opinions to themselves , but its hard to not miss journalists snarky comments about the president on Twitter .
CNN host Reza Aslan lashed out at the president , calling him a " piece of shit " on Twitter for Trumps remarks following the June 2017 London terror attacks . "
I lost my cool and responded to him in a derogatory fashion , " apologized Aslan .
CNN canceled his show .
In September 2017 , former ESPN host Jemele Hill tweeted the president is a white supremacist , which earned her a hand slap from her employer .
After a second controversial tweet , Hill was suspended for two weeks and was reassigned to ESPNs The Undefeated .
In December 2016 , Politico reporter Julia Ioffe was fired due to an obscene tweet about Ivanka Trump .
Journalists used to get a lot more second chances .
But they ve lost that cushion with the Trump White House , because the relationship is far more adversarial than with other administrations .
Each time a journalist makes a mistake , lashes out , loses control or shows their animosity , it further erodes public trust .
And public trust is something journalists and news organizations simply can not afford to risk or lose .

All hail the champ - champ , the conqueror of two divisions , he of the two belts and the mean right hand .
Thanks to his victory in the UFC 226 main event Saturday night , Daniel Cormier now holds UFC titles in both the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions - and he means to defend them both .
So he says , anyway .
So his plan goes .
But we ve heard this one before in MMA , and we ve yet to see it work out that way .
Remember the last double champ , this mouthy Irish guy with a love of profane pinstripes and a hatred of buses ?
He also teased the idea of defending both of his two UFC titles after he won first the featherweight and then the lightweight belt .
That was nearly two years ago .
Since then , McGregor has been stripped of both belts after defending neither .
He has nt competed at all in the entire sport of MMA since claiming that second title , and it does nt seem like he has any immediate plans to change that .
So that s one way things can go .
The other is the vision Cormier has set out for himself , which includes a 205-pound title defense in the fall and a heavyweight title defense in the winter .
After that ?
His birthday , the big 4 - 0 , and then retirement .
So long and thanks for all the money .
But lets be real here , the money fight for Cormier ( and for the UFC ) is not at light heavyweight .
Not unless another bout of diverticulitis knocks Brock Lesnar down about 80 pounds .
The payday is waiting at heavyweight , where Cormier can defend the moniker of " baddest man on the planet " against a proven pro wrestling pay - per - view draw .
That fight ca nt happen until January at the earliest , thanks to Lesnars lingering USADA suspension .
But putting Cormier in the cage before then to defend his other title is a big risk .
What if he gets beat ?
What if he gets hurt ?
These are very real possibilities for a champ in his late 30s who ll have to take off weight right after putting it on .
But if Cormier does nt defend his light heavyweight title before fighting Lesnar , he s unlikely to defend it all .
And then what ?
The simple answer is that hell probably be stripped and the UFC will have to bestow it upon some other light heavyweight , who may or may not get the legitimacy that usually comes with a belt .
Plus , at some point fans might get wise to the whole double champ routine , since what s the point if no one ever keeps the belts they ve won ?
There s also another question still yet to be answered : What happens to both these titles if Cormier follows through on his retirement plans ?
Whether he defends the 205-pound belt or not , it ll likely end up vacant sooner or later , especially if Cormier truly has less than a year left in this sport .
And whether he wins or loses against Lesnar , who clearly has no plans of becoming a full - time fighter at this point , the heavyweight strap is also likely to be orphaned soon .
In that sense , its not so different from what happened after McGregor claimed two titles at the same time , even if its all for very different reasons .
As much fun as it is to watch a reigning champion chase down a second title , sorting through the aftermath has proven to be a whole lot tougher .

Americans paid banks some $ 104 billion in credit - card interest and fees in the last year , up 11 % on the year and 35 % over the last five years , according to the personal - finance website MagnifyMoney , which analyzed data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) through March 2018 .
The bad news : That number will likely only rise this year .
The Federal Reserve has forecast four interest rate hikes ( one every three months ) in 2018 .
The Fed has increased interest rates twice this year to between 1.75 % and 2 % and has penciled in two more quarter - point moves .
When the Fed raises rates , which it in June , credit - card debt gets more expensive , because banks often pass on those higher rates to customers .
Consumers with credit - card debt will likely pay an additional $ 2.2 billion this year in interest payments because of the last rate hike , the credit - card website CompareCards found .
If the Fed raises rates a total of four times this year , it will create a total of $ 110 billion for Americans to pay in credit - card interest and fees , MagnifyMoney found .
Collectively , that s a huge amount , said Nick Clements , co - founder of MagnifyMoney .
But people making payments on their credit cards are less likely to notice than those who make mortgage payments . "
Most people will only see their minimum due increase by a couple of dollars , " he said . "
Its not dramatic . "
Everything we thought about millennials ' money habits was wrong Additional interest - rate hikes can hurt those carrying large amounts of debt .
Americans carry a collective $ 687 billion in credit - card debt that is not paid in full each month , Clements said .
That breaks down to an average balance of $ 6,348 for people with credit cards , according to the credit agency Experian EXPN , +1.51 % .
One bright spot : When the Fed raises rates , some banks offer higher rates on savings products , including savings accounts and CDs , Greg McBride , chief financial analyst at the personal - finance website Bankrate previously told MarketWatch .
Some consumers are taking that seriously .
Americans paid back $ 40.3 billion in credit - card debt during the first quarter of 2018 , an analysis of data by personal - finance website WalletHub concluded .
But they have a lot left to pay off .
In 2017 , Americans hit a record high of $ 1.02 trillion in outstanding revolving debt , which is often categorized as credit - card debt .
In April 2018 , they still had more $ 1.03 trillion to pay off , Federal Reserve said earlier this month .
The accumulation of large amounts of debt before the Great Recession and subsequent financial crash has nt taught consumers a lasting lesson , Clements said .
Banks have loosened up their credit criteria , he added . "
People are borrowing again , and they re borrowing on credit cards . "

Although J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM , -0.59 % beat total revenue expectations for an 11th - straight quarter , consumer and community banking ( CCB ) was a weak spot , hurt by a decline in home lending .
Net revenue rose to $ 12.50 billion from $ 11.41 billion , below the FactSet consensus of $ 12.57 billion .
Within CCB , consumer and business banking revenue rose 17 % to $ 6.1 billion as higher deposit margins boosted net interest income , and card , merchant services and auto revenue grew 6 % to $ 5.0 billion on lower card costs , higher net interest income and higher auto lease volumes , but home lending revenue dropped 6 % to $ 1.3 billion amid margin compression and lower net servicing revenue .
Separately , J.P. Morgan beat second - quarter earnings expectations , for the 14th - straight quarter .
J.P. Morgan 's stock , which rose 0.9 % in premarket trade , has lost 3.1 % over the past three months through Thursday , while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF , -1.11 % has slipped 1.3 % and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % has gained 5.4 % .
Alysha Tsuji USA TODAY About two months after making a game - changing mistake at the end of regulation in the Cavaliers ' devastating Game 1 overtime loss to the Warriors in the NBA Finals , J.R. Smith is now joking and laughing about it .
Smith posted a photo of one of his daughters and wrote that that 's how she looked at him when " I did n't shoot after Game 1 ! "
He added laughing emojis , facepalm emojis and eyes emojis .
Right when Smith made the blunder , James was furious .
Afterwards , James told reporters that Smith " probably took that loss as hard as anybody . "
But now that the Warriors won the title and James is on the Lakers , Smith is getting a good laugh out of it .
You can never take life too seriously , right ?

Alysha Tsuji USA TODAY Blaze Pizza , the pizza chain that LeBron James invests in , celebrated the star signing with the Lakers by giving out free pizzas at their Los Angeles locations for a few hours on Tuesday .
While lots of people were pumped about free food , things got really crazy after James tweeted about it .
The three - time champ wrote that he had n't been to a pizza party in a minute along with " Culver City ? "
He added a thinking face emoji and eyes emojis .
The tweet is vague , but it was enough to draw hundreds of fans to the location just in case James decided to make an appearance .
Many reporters were there with fans to document the madness .
Here are all the tweets : No one ever knew if James was going to show up or not .
People still lined up starting hours before the promotion started ( free pizza was from 2 - 5 p.m. ) .
Kids made signs to welcome him .
The founders were there too .
Fans drove for hours to maybe see James .
The traffic was so bad , but honestly , it 's always bad in LA .
There were signs , jerseys , hats and Laker cars - everything .
There was a heartbreaking false alarm .
Within the last hour of the pizza party , fans began to realize James might not show .
Half an hour after the pizza party ended , The Athletic 's Joe Lago tweeted the official word : James would not be picking up any pizza in Culver City .
Meanwhile , James ' wife , Savannah , shared this photo of her husband floating in a doughnut .
We 'll all have to wait and see if James comments on any of this .
One one hand , James never explicitly stated that he was going to greet fans at the Blaze Pizza in Culver City , but on the other hand , why would he tweet out that specific location for no reason ?
At the end of the day , the result was lots of unhappy fans , and you can bet there will be many jokes and very serious remarks about how Kobe Bryant would 've been there .

Alysha Tsuji USA TODAY Giants rookie running back Saquon Barkley has enormous legs .
It 's not a surprising fact when you think about what a beast he was at Penn State and at the NFL combine , but it 's incredible .
When Eli Manning went on Bleacher Report 's Simms and Lefkoe podcast , even the quarterback admitted that he 's also impressed by the size of Barkley 's legs .
Manning said : " His quads are the size of my waist and whole upper body .
I 've never quite seen anything like it .
I do n't often stare at another man 's legs , but in that case , you just ca n't quite help it . "
Manning is full of jokes when it comes to his athletic teammates .
When he was asked about his teammates , such as Barkley and Odell Beckham Jr. , going shirtless for their workouts while Manning always wears a shirt , the QB jokingly said , per NJ.com , " We do practice with our shirts on with the Giants .
With the friction , they might have to make an adjustment the first few weeks .
It might be something new for them and take a little time to get used to that . "

Alysha Tsuji USA TODAY LeBron James officially signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday .
The next day , Spectrum SportsNet aired an interview with Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka in which the two of them talked about what went into signing the superstar .
Pelinka revealed how he first round out that James was picking the Lakers .
The Lakers general manager says it was a text from James ' agent Rich Paul that informed him James was going to leave Cleveland for Los Angeles , and all the text said was " Congrats " along with balloons .
Pelinka says it was an unforgettable moment .
It 's pretty funny to imagine that such a huge decision that changes the entire NBA was first announced with a one - word text message .
It was n't a video call .
It was n't a phone call .
It was n't a long message .
It was simply " Congrats " plus balloons .
But that fits with how James has handled this NBA free agency .
It 's the opposite of what he did the last time he left the Cavaliers when he announced he was taking his talents to South Beach on live TV , and then the Heat basically threw a huge party .
This time , James announced he selected the Lakers with a press release , and then he left for a vacation in Europe without doing any interviews .
Pelinka said in the Spectrum SN segment : " There was not a lot of fanfare . (
LeBron James is ) not looking to celebrate signing , he 's looking to celebrate championships and he made that real clear . "
Here are some other interesting parts tweeted out by Spectrum SN 's Mike Bresnahan and Mike Trudell : Johnson showed up to his meeting with James an hour early and just waited outside James ' house .
Johnson and Pelinka gave James a say when signing Lance Stephenson , JaVale McGee and Rajon Rondo .
Johnson explained how he connected with James immediately .

Alysha Tsuji USA TODAY Luke Walton won a championship as an assistant coach with the Warriors a few years ago .
Now , as Lakers head coach , he 's going to try winning one with LeBron James .
He got lots of congratulatory messages around the time James made his big announcement , but the best one definitely came from his dad .
In a fantastic feature story that published on Tuesday night , ESPN 's Ramona Shelburne reported this incredible detail : Luke 's father , Bill Walton , would call him from a Grateful Dead concert to help celebrate . "
Yeah , and he had [ drummer ] Mickey Hart in the background yelling at me that , ' The rhythm is the answer to everything in life , ' " Luke Walton said with a laugh . "
So once I figure out what that means , we 'll be good . "
Bill Walton absolutely loves the Grateful Dead , so this is just perfect .
The Hall of Famer once gave his co - host bottled air from a concert while broadcasting a college basketball game , he has spent lots of time talking about the band during broadcasts and he has been to hundreds of shows .
Also , Bill Walton is very proud of his son for all of his coaching success so far .
Bill said of watching Luke serve as interim head coach of the Warriors in 2016 , " It was fantastic , the level of pride , the level of joy , the level of happiness .
There 's nothing like the pride of a dad . "
After Luke got the job with the Lakers , Bill shared an adorable baby photo and wrote , " Who would have ever thought that little Luke Walton would be the head coach of the Lakers , so happy for him . "

Amazon can seemingly do no wrong , with the company constantly disrupting major industries , and consumers increasingly integrating its offerings into every aspect of their daily lives .
Just this week , Amazon sent pharmacy stocks reeling after it announced it was buying online pharmacy PillPack .
The markets reaction underscored how Amazons entry into key sectors leaves the competition scrambling to adjust , and increased speculation that the retail giant is poised to upend yet another industry . "
This acquisition could be the launchpad for the long - feared broader entry of Amazon into retail pharmacy space , just months after news reports had brought some relief that Amazon was not ready yet to enter drug distribution , " Evercore ISI told its clients in a research note Thursday .
By all appearances , the Amazon juggernaut ca nt be slowed .
However , a recent report suggests Amazon 's growth may actually be reaching a plateau -- creating a potential opening for competitors trying to bring the behemoth down .
According to data from RBCs latest online shopping survey , Amazon Prime membership growth is showing signs of slowing down .
At 55 percent , just over half of the U.S. is subscribed to Prime , Amazons recurring subscription service , RBC said -- a level consistent with 2017s figures . "
This was the first year when Prime penetration did n't rise .
A surprising result , which implies Prime expansion is likely mostly / totally driven by international markets , " said Mark Mahaney , RBC 's lead internet analyst .
To be sure , Amazon remains the retailer to beat , even though it hiked the Prime membership price by 20 percent in May to $ 119 .
Immediately after , the stock hit new highs as investors bet on Amazon maintaining its lead with consumers and the competition .
However , RBCs data underscore how potentially slowing growth in the U.S. could undermine Amazons " flywheel " effect -- a bet that lower prices and membership perks will draw in more customers -- and lead to more Prime - eligible items and sellers .
That virtuous cycle makes Prime more valuable , and attracts ever more subscribers .
Amazon has turned Prime Day into one of the biggest online shopping holidays .
But for many sellers , its becoming more expensive to participate .
For the second year in a row , Amazon has increased the registration fee to run Prime Day Lightning Deals , which are limited - time promotions exclusively offered to Prime members .
It now costs third - party merchants $ 750 to run each Lightning Deal , up from $ 500 last year , according to an invitation that was sent to sellers and viewed by CNBC .
Amazon first introduced the fee for Prime Day last year , after not charging anything in 2015 and 2016 .
The fee hikes for Prime Day , which will be held on July 16 and 17 , are another example of how Amazon is squeezing more money out of the sellers who wish to take part in the company 's annual shopping extravaganza , now in its fourth year .
By charging more in fees , Amazon not only makes additional cash but also filters out sellers who are n't confident that their products will be popular enough to justify the costs .
That s important because Lightning Deals are a big draw but have often received poor reviews on past Prime Days , said Sean Adams , an analyst at marketing agency Merkle . "
The fee hike is going to make the sellers be more intentional with what products and deals they re going to choose " on Prime Day , Adams told CNBC .
Lightning Deals , which are offered year - round on Amazons " Todays Deals " page , become more important on Prime Day because of the spike in traffic and exposure .
All Lightning Deals become exclusive to Prime members on Prime Day and are highlighted in short intervals throughout the day .
Sellers have to meet additional requirements , like a minimum 20 percent discount and a three - star or higher rating on each product they submit .
Amazon typically charges $ 150 per Lightning Deal on normal shopping days .
Amazon now has over 100 million Prime members worldwide , and Prime Day continues to break sales records every year -- making Lightning Deals a valuable asset .
Amazon planning holiday toy catalog now that Toys R Us is gone : Report CNBC 's Courtney Reagan sheds light on reports that Amazon is capitalizing on the demise of Toys R Us with its own toy catalogs .
Amazon Prime Day ( or days ) is highly anticipated for some online shoppers -- but others might be better off waiting until the sounds of jingle bells are in the air to hunt for bargains .
The popular annual promotion , which last year caused Amazons website to crash , will take place over 48 hours on July 15 and July 16 .
The event will features sales on thousands of items sold through the online retailer and will even include a live concert broadcast through Amazons Prime Video streaming service featuring Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa .
Last year , the average shopper was forecast to spend $ 167 during the event , including $ 70 on back - to - school items , according to discount website RetailMeNot .
Amazon AMZN , -1.81 % has already announced significant discounts on items like binders , backpacks and lunch boxes , as the Prime Day sales event has become the unofficial kickoff to the back - to - school shopping season . (
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment . )
Historically , the steepest Prime Day discounts are found on Amazons own devices such as the Echo smart home assistants and Kindle tablets -- and that s true again this year .
Major savings can also be found on subscription services from Amazon , including Audible .
For instance , the Fire TV Recast device was on sale for $ 129.99 at the start of Prime Day , which is $ 100 off its regular price .
Additionally , the Echo Input smart speaker will cost buyers only $ 14.99 on Prime Day , which is $ 20 off its usual retail price .

Deals like that will in many cases match the sales prices that consumers will find on these same items come holiday shopping season -- but there s a catch .
During the holiday shopping season , retailers will often sweeten the deals on gaming consoles by throwing in gift cards or free games .
On Cyber Monday last year , GameStop GME , -8.34 % shoppers could get the Nintendo Switch plus a $ 50 gift card for $ 300 .
And Walmart offered a Black Friday bundle for the Xbox One that included the game Minecraft ( along with the in - game Minecoin currency ) and a months subscription to Xbox game pass for just $ 199 . "
Gaming consoles are very popular holiday gifts , " said Kristin McGrath , editor and shopping expert at Offers.com . "
Those are going to be a smarter buy around the holidays and Cyber Monday . "
The hottest toys Much like with video games , consumers are better off waiting to shop for toys .
But in this case , Black Friday and Cyber Monday wo nt be much better for in terms of getting savings on presents for your little ones .
Instead , Dengler recommends buying toys in December in the weeks leading up to Christmas when lots of toys are still in stock at very low prices .

And they have the ability to increase the items price in the days and weeks before Prime Day , Cook said . (
Amazon can also add its own discount to the prices of third - party sellers items and it charges a fee to these third - party retailers . )
Even if a deal looks good , use a price comparison tool such as Camelcamelcamel or The Tracktor to check how the sale compares to the long - term average price . "

There 's nothing better than a backyard cookout , cold drink in hand .
Across the U.S. , we have our differences when it comes to melt - in - your mouth brisket versus tender pulled pork ; charcoal , gas or wood grills ; and even intra - state debates about the best way to cook a whole hog .
But any way you slice it , we love our BBQ .
Advertisement And we 're not alone .
Virtually every country has its own style of barbecue ( if not many styles ) .
Across the rest of the world , from South America to the South Pacific , people have been gathering to passionately cook over an open flame for centuries .
Here are a few of the best styles of BBQ across the globe : China | Shaokao Among the most underrated barbecue on earth is the street - side shaokao of China .
For some reason , despite being ridiculously addictive , this style of grilled skewers has nt really found its way stateside .
Busy streets and night markets throughout China are filled with all manner of meat , seafood , vegetables and fungus on bamboo skewers .
My favorite were in Chengdu , the capital of Sichuan province , where diners fill a basket with skewers of their choice that have been seasoned with a generous dose of cumin and Chinese five - spice powder , and hand it to the cook , who will ( often ) fry it before finishing it off on an open flame .
Mexico | Barbacoa If you frequent chipotle or your local taco truck , there s a good chance you ve had something called barbacoa .
There s an equally good chance that its a only a distant relative of the barbacoa they make south of the border .
Rather than the braised beef ( or occasionally goat ) you ll find stateside , in Mexico barbacoa meat - sheep , lamb cow , goat , and sometimes even pork , depending on region - is buried in a pit in the earth , covered in agave leaves and cooked verrrrrry slowly until its soft enough to pull apart into tender strings of meat .
It 's usually served in a broth and eaten as a soup or with tortillas to make some of the best tacos you 'll ever eat .
Argentina | Asado In Argentina , they let the meat speak for itself .
In this beef - loving country , asados are an all - day affair where slow - cooked meat comes off the grill - or often just a wire rack placed upright in the ground near an open flame -throughout the afternoon / evening .
You ll usually find everything from the more popular cuts of steak to shanks , intestines and brain , and occasionally even a whole animal .
Usually your meat will be seasoned with little more than salt , though light and herbaceous chimichurri sauce is often on hand .
Philippines | Lechon Whole roasted pig is common throughout the Caribbean , Pacific and Southeast Asia , but nobody does it better than the Philippines - at least according to Anthony Bourdain ( and we ca nt disagree , though Balis babi guling is right up there ) .
Generally reserved for holidays and celebratory occasions , lechon is prepared with slightly different ingredients from region to region , but generally a piglet aged between three and six months old is marinated in a mixture of salt , pepper and fish sauce for up to a few days , stuffed with herbs and slow roasted on a spit for several hours .
The result is tender meat , and trademark crispy , almost shard - like skin .
Brazil | Churrasco Brazil might be most famous for its wild Carnival celebration , its postcard - perfect beaches and its soccer prowess , but churrasco is arguably its greatest export .
You can find Brazilian BBQ restaurants ( or churrascarias ) all over the world , where skewers of all kinds of meat - from prime cuts of beef to sausages to chicken hearts - are slow - roasted over a bed of coals and delivered tableside until you ve eaten so much you ca nt move .
And make sure you try those chicken hearts ; they just might be the best thing you eat all night .
India | Tandoor Photo courtesy of Photo via Getty Images / Helovi A tandoor is s a cylindrical clay oven with a heat source that s either wood or charcoal .
Its something of a cross between a traditional BBQ and a convection oven that gets ridiculously hot - like 900degF hot , which , for comparison , is probably between 200 and 300 degrees hotter than your grill and 400 degrees hotter than the oven you ve got at home .
The result is juicy skewered meats that are more or less baked in their own smoke , creating a unique , smoky flavor .
Everything from breads like naan and chapati to kebab and tandoori chicken to tikka ( meat , cheese or fish marinated in yogurt and a dry spice mixture ) are cooked in tandoors .
Japan |Yakitori Photo courtesy of Photo via Getty Images / PaylessImages In the States , yakitori is usually one of those things you get as an appetizer at a pan - Asian restaurant or something you order at a sushi restaurant for your friend who , despite it being 2018 , still refuses to eat raw fish .
In Japan , yakitori restaurants generally serve little more than yakitori , perhaps a few sides , rice and noodles , and , of course , beer to wash down the yakitori .
These skewers of virtually any part of the chicken are either seasoned with salt or glazed in teriyaki sauce .
One thing most yakitori restaurants have in common is that they use a very unique type of white charcoal called binchotan , which is about the only charcoal on earth that s safe to burn indoors .
Korea | Gogigui Photo courtesy of Photo via Getty Images / Supamon R In Korea , they call it " gogigui , " but you probably know it as Korean BBQ .
And if you live in New York - or any other major metropolitan city - you ve probably taken a date to a gogigui joint or gone for a friend 's birthday party to cook your own banchan ( sides like fresh veggies and kimchi ) , bulgogi ( marinated beef ) and kalbi ( short rib ) on the grill that s built into your table .
And if you have nt , well you re missing out - its kind of like fondue , except it actually tastes good in addition to being fun .
Ikan Bakar | Indonesia Photo courtesy of Photo via Getty Images / didoi Ikan bakar is a method of cooking fish over a bed of charcoals .
The exact techniques and sauces vary throughout the islands of this vast archipelago , but the fish is often butterflied , marinated in a spice mixture and placed between two grates or wrapped in a banana leaf that go directly on the grill .
The sauces , sambals , vary depending on region , but they often include shallots , coriander , garlic , tamarind , turmeric and chilies , and can range from spicy - sweet to I - NEED - MILK - NOW fiery . (
Ayam bakar is chicken cooked similarly ) .
This is , unfortunately , another one of those impossibly tasty barbecue styles that inexplicably has nt made its way across the globe .
Umu , imu , himaa , lovo , koua , tou , mumu , etc .
| Pacific Islands Earth ovens are among the most ancient ways to cook , and while much f the world has moved on from using them , they re still used commonly throughout the Pacific islands .
While the cooking methods - and names - differ from island to island , cultures throughout the Melanesian and Polynesian Islands , and the rest of the Pacific , still bury their meat in a pit in the earth , Its generally marinated , finished with a savory glaze and topped with tropical fruit .
Americans with enough savings to cover three to five months of expenses edged higher to 18 percent , from 17 percent last year .
Those with some savings , but not enough to cover three months ' expenses , rose to 22 percent from 20 percent -- which is an improvement but still not great .
Overall , however , Americans are doing a better job at saving .
Across nearly all ages and generations , from millennials to baby boomers , one - quarter of Americans , or roughly 55 million people , said they had nothing saved in an emergency fund , according to a Bankrate.com survey of 1,000 adults conducted last month . (
The Silent Generation -- over age 73 -- were much more likely to have something set aside . ) "
Many Americans are kidding themselves if they have less than three months worth of expenses in emergency savings and claim to have any level of comfort with that , " Bankrate 's Greg McBride said in a statement .
McBride recommends stashing at least a six - month cushion to cover anything from a dental bill to a car repair -- but more if you are the sole breadwinner in your family or in business for yourself .
Generally , the likelihood of having saved at least six months of expenses increases steadily with age , Bankrate said .
More than a third , or 36 percent , of boomers and 42 percent of those in the silent generation had achieved that saving milestone .
To get there , McBride suggests paying yourself first . "
Set up a direct deposit from your paycheck into a dedicated savings account .
If you wait until the end of the month , nothing will be left over , " he said .
If there is , in fact , a surplus once all expenses have been paid out , " that gives you a second bite . "

Amid a heated bidding war between Walt Disney and Comcast over Twenty - First Century Fox 's assets , the summer box office has rarely been hotter .
Since the start of 2018 , Hollywood has churned out successive blockbusters , closing out a record second quarter with more than $ 6 billion in ticket sales , according to Box Office Mojo .
That puts the industry on pace for its highest level since 2013 , comScore 's Paul Dergarabedian told CNBC 's " Closing Bell " this week .
This is already a huge rebound from last year , when ticket sales fell to their lowest level in more than a decade , according to a report from Box Office Mojo .
Universal Studios ' " Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom " is leading the charge , pulling in more than $ 60 million last weekend .
The latest " Jurassic Park " installment collected a worldwide cumulative audience that stands at $ 932.4 million , well on its way to topping $ 1 billion worldwide over the coming week .
Disney 's and Pixar 's " Incredibles 2 " brought in an estimated $ 45.5 million over the weekend as it begins its third week in release .
It is the second - highest grossing Pixar film of all time and third - largest animated title ever with a worldwide cumulative audience of $ 646.8 million so far .
Domestic summer revenue has accumulated $ 2 billion as of June 26 , with $ 1.2 billion or 60 percent market share coming from Disney .
With their movies leading the top two spots , Pivotal Research senior analyst Brian Wieser told " Closing Bell " that the question of Comcast versus Disney bidding over Twenty - First Century Fox is about where the company will invest their assets , not the quality of the movies themselves . "
The bigger picture is will Disney , if they end up with Fox , end up with a sufficiently large portfolio of content , " said Wieser , " that they do n't need to then go invest in say $ 10 billion a year in new original content to populate these streaming services they want if they do not end up with the Fox assets . "
Dergarabedian said although Universal 's film is topping the box office , both " Jurassic World " and " Incredibles 2 " are both winning , with ticket sales for both movies totaling more than $ 1 billion .
Still , he said the overall winner is the box office , having its most successful quarter in movie history between April and June after pulling in $ 3.3 billion . "
With all this streaming and all these available options for entertainment , the fact that the movie theater is booming right now shows that it 's not going anywhere , " Dergarabedian said .
Rounding out the top four movies right now are Sony 's " Sicario : Day of the Soldado " and Lions Gate Entertainment 's " Uncle Drew " which are expected to bring in about $ 50 million and $ 35 million , respectively .
Warner Bros. ' " Ocean 's 8 " is currently fifth in the rankings , having generated $ 13.8 million internationally over the weekend . --
Disclosure : Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal , parent company of CNBC and Universal Studios .
CNBC 's sister company Universal Studios competes with Disney .
An Alabama college student walked 20 miles in the dark to get to his new job -- an act of dedication that inspired the companys CEO to gift him a car .
Walter Carr , who could nt find a ride after his car broke down , started walking from Homewood at midnight in order to arrive at his Bellhops moving job in Pelham by 8 a.m. Friday .
Pelham police picked him up around 4 a.m. and took him to breakfast before dropping him off at the home of Bellhops customer Jenny Lamey .
Lamey said Carr , despite walking for hours , declined her offer to rest and had plenty of energy for the job , according to a GoFundMe page she started to help him with his car troubles . "
I just ca nt tell you how touched I was by Walter and his journey .
He is humble and kind and cheerful and he had big dreams !
He is hardworking and tough , " she wrote on Facebook .
Rex Nutting : There are millions of Americans like that guy who walked 20 miles to work After seeing the Facebook FB , -4.27 % post , Bellhops CEO Luke Marklin drove from Tennessee to Alabama on Monday and presented his dedicated new employee with his personal 2014 Ford Escape .
Both Lamey and Marklin felt compelled to help Carr , who moved to the Birmingham area from New Orleans after he and his mother lost their home in Hurricane Katrina . "
Decisions in your life that are sometimes big and that you make pretty quickly because they re the right thing to do -- and this was one of them , " Marklin told WMBA .
Carr , who hopes to be a U.S. Marine one day , made the late - night journey after his 2003 Nissan Altima broke down .
He calculated it would take seven hours to get to his first moving gig with the Bellhops moving company , AL.com reported .
He was trekking along Highway 280 when concerned police officers stopped to check on his well - being .
After Carr told them his story , they bought him breakfast before delivering him to Lameys home an hour and a half early . "
We all decided , hey , you know , lets go get him some breakfast and get him somewhere safe , " Officer Mark Knighten told WBMA . "
Proud to have encountered this young man .
He certainly made an impact on us , " the Pelham police department tweeted .
Carr says he hopes his story inspires others to fight for what they want out of life , even if it means having sore feet . "
I wanted to show them that I have the dedication and that I always have [ it ] in my life and that I am going to get to this job one way or the other .
I tell people if you think over 20 miles is a lot , then come walk in my shoes because my shoes was really killing me that day , " he said .

An assailant broke into a Georgia residence owned by Buffalo Bills Pro Bowl running back LeSean McCoy early Tuesday morning and assaulted McCoy 's estranged girlfriend and sought jewelry McCoy had given her , according to Delicia Cordon 's attorney .
The man hit Cordon " in the face with a firearm multiple times " and " demanded specific items of jewelry ... which Mr. McCoy had requested back on many occasions , " Atlanta - based lawyer Tanya Mitchell Graham said in statement .
Graham released graphic photos of Cordon showing injuries to her face and wrist .
Cordons female cousin , who was staying at the residence , was struck by the assailant with a firearm .
Milton ( Ga. ) police said in a statement Tuesday that an adult female was treated and released at North Fulton Regional Hospital , and that a second adult female " sustained a minor injury during the incident . "
Graham did nt allege that McCoy played a part in the home invasion , but referenced recent efforts by McCoy to remove Cordon from the residence .
Milton police said in a statement its " preliminary investigation indicates that this residence was specifically targeted by the suspect or suspects , and not a random incident . "
Said Graham : " After Ms. Cordon refused to return her jewelry gifts to Mr. McCoy , he would often suggest to Ms. Cordon that she could be robbed because the jewelry was expensive . "
Cordon has lived at the home with her children for nearly two years .
Graham said McCoy 's surrogates have attempted to evict her .
She alleged in a court filing that an eviction notice on behalf of McCoy was wrongly given to the woman 's 16-year - old son and thus ca nt be enforced .
On June 1 while Cordon was out of the state attending her sisters graduation , Graham said McCoy had relatives , friends and laborers " attempt to wrongfully evict Ms. Cordon from the residence . "
Cordon saw the footage on her cell phone , streamed from the security system at the residence , and called police to stop the removal of items from the house .
McCoy changed the security system in the house and did not give Cordon access to the system , according to Graham .
McCoy : Allegation of beating woman , drug use ' completely false ' Bills training camp questions : Will Josh Allen seize starting QB job ? "
Since this mornings attack on Ms. Cordon , Mr. McCoy has not contacted her to check on her condition or to see what was going on at the residence , " Graham said . "
She has no idea whether Mr. McCoy was able to live stream to see the incident or to see the law enforcement vehicles , fire truck and ambulance at his home . "
Messages left with McCoys agent and attorney by USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday were not returned .
A picture of Cordons battered face in a since - deleted post on Instagram along with allegations McCoy had abused his own child , drugs , a dog and Cordon previously focused immense scrutiny on McCoy on Tuesday . "
For the record , the totally baseless and offensive claims made against me today on social media are completely false , " McCoy said in a statement to his official Twitter and Instagram accounts . "
Further more ( sic ) , I have not had any direct contact with any of the people involved in months . "

An assistant coach , an Australian physician , a handful of Thailand 's navy Seals and 100 determined professional first responders and volunteers were hailed as heroes Wednesday for the daring rescue of 12 members of the now - famous Wild Boars youth soccer team .
Video released Wednesday from the hospital shows the boys , wearing hospital gowns and masks and sitting up in their beds , making victory signs to the camera and waving to ecstatic parents .
Family members , some near tears , wave back from behind glass .
The boys were famished and weak when they were found , having lost an average of more than 4 pounds each .
But their spirits were high , and the rescue team brought them nutritional gels to slowly build their strength .
All will remain in the hospital for several more days .
They are now eating regular food , and some will be going home in a week . "
Overall , the 13 people are in very good condition , " Thai health official Thongchai Lertwilairatanapong said .
More : Out of the cave , onto the big screen : Hollywood takes on Thai rescue More : Thai cave rescue operation saves boys , coach : What comes next Chaiwetch Thanapaisal , director of Chiangrai Prachanukroh Hospital , said the boys will be hospitalized for at least a week , then spend the next month at home recuperating .
The boys and their coach , Ekapol Chantawong , walked into the cave June 23 after soccer practice for what was supposed to be a few hours of exploration .
Heavy rains trapped them there , and it was 10 days before the first rescuers found them .
It took more than a week after that for an international team of rescuers to get them all out .
A Thai navy Seal ran out of oxygen and died during the preparations .
The tragedy highlighted the dangers the cave presented .
The group was extracted over three days .
The final mission on Tuesday involved 100 people , including more than a dozen divers and Australian physician Richard Harris , who emerged from the cave after caring for the boys to learn that his own father had died .
Expert divers guided each boy for several hours , navigating more than 2 miles of the narrow , twisting , dark and dangerous labyrinth .
Some sections involved diving , and the boys were packed in wetsuits and facemasks while their companion divers carried oxygen tanks .
Other sections of the cave involved walking , wading , crawling and climbing .
Derek Anderson , a U.S. Air Force rescue specialist who was with a team of Americans aiding the operation , said some sections were dry but steep and rocky . "
We had to set up rope systems and high - lines to be able to safely put them in a harness and bring them across large open areas , " Anderson said . "
The world just needs to know that what was accomplished was a once - in - a - lifetime rescue . " "
Coach Ek " has drawn praise for his efforts to keep the boys alive for the almost 10 days they were trapped before being found .
They drank only water that dripped from the walls , not the murky brew that trapped them .
He taught them meditation to calm them and ate a smaller share of the few snacks they had brought in .
They are survivors , and for some that is nothing new .
Coach Ek and three of the boys have no nationality .
They are from tribes in an area around Mae Sai known as the " Golden Triangle " stretching across parts of Thailand , Myanmar , Laos and China where borders have shifted and passports do n't exist . "
He is stateless .
No nationality .
No country , " Nopparat Khanthavong , founder of the Wild Boars club , told AFP .
The United Nations Refugee Agency estimates Thailand is home to more than 400,000 stateless people .
The Thai government has pledged to attain zero statelessness by 2024 . "
To get nationality is the biggest hope for the boys , " Nopparat said . "
In the past , these boys have problems traveling to play matches outside of Chiang Rai because of their nationless status . "
Efforts are underway to provide the boys with Thai nationality .
And they will be returning to their homes and schools as kings .
Manchester United , a professional soccer team in Britain with fans around the globe , has invited them to a game .
They even have an open invitation to Sunday 's World Cup final game in Russia , though for medical reasons they are unlikely to attend .
The world is thankful .
Thailand is ecstatic . "
We did something nobody thought possible , " acting local Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said . "
It was mission possible for team Thailand . "

Hash rate shows bitcoin set for rally Earlier this morning , one analyst predicted the fortunes were about to change for holders of bitcoin thanks to the computers that mine for the digital currency . "
The price is trading at $ 6,715 and year to date it is down nearly 53.07 % .
However , I do think that the tide is about to turn for bitcoin and it wo nt be long before we see a major move , " wrote Naeem Aslam , chief market analyst at Think Markets U.K. " The evidence is in the hash rate which is consistently increasing , meaning , that miners are still very busy , and they hold the view that the price is going to rise , " he said .
Bitcoin , similarly to other cryptocurrencies are virtually mined by solving complex computations .
The hash rate refers to the rate at which those cryptographic puzzles are solved and rewards are doled out to so - called miners in the form of new bitcoin or other digital assets .

FSB added that they have engaged the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to gather data on potential exposure banks may have as a result of digital currencies .
While the report dropped no bombshells , Nigel Green , founder and CEO of DeVere Group , a financial consulting firm , said the report is further validation for the digital currency industry . "

With the S&P 500 not far from the firm 's 2018 year - end target , Goldman Sachs says there is still an investment strategy that can outperform .
The firm recommended companies with high and stable profit margins .
That 's because despite the one - time boost to profit from the corporate tax cut , companies face a number of challenges to maintaining profit margins , including rising commodity prices , rising interest rates and wage growth .
All of these cut into margins . "
Investors should focus on stocks with high and stable gross margins , " wrote David Kostin , Goldman 's chief U.S. equity strategist , in a report Friday to clients . "
The market generally rewards companies with high margins when the outlook for corporate profitability weakens . "
Kostin reiterated his year - end price target of 2,850 for the S&P 500 , representing just 3 percent upside from Fridays close .
The strategist noted that Russell 1000 stocks in the top quintile of each of their sectors for stable gross profit margin levels outperformed low gross margin stocks by 14 percentage points so far this year . "
We expect the trade will continue to outperform as the margin tailwind from tax reform passes , " he said .
Here are five companies in the Goldman Sachs " high and stable gross margins " stock basket recommended by Kostin .

Perhaps not well understood is that 2019 is shaping up to be much like 2018 , with management now messaging no decline in cash restructuring and only a modest decline in book restructuring , " he added .
An inverted yield curve may not be a dreaded harbinger of doom for the bull market , according to Ryan Detrick , senior market strategist at LPL Research , who believes that stocks have awhile to go before worrying about unseemly yield curves or even a recession .
In an economically ideal world , long - term interest rates stay in their designated lane and maintain a certain gap above short - term rates with the twain never meeting .
Yet , they do intersect once in a while and even invert in times of uncertainty .
An inverted yield curve , where long - term yields such as the 10-year Treasury yield drop below their shorter - term peers , symbolizes a lack of confidence in the economy .
It has also emerged as a closely watched early warning signal for economic trouble , particularly in the wake of research from the San Francisco Federal Reserve that every U.S. recession in the past 60 years was preceded by an inverted yield curve .
This week , the spread between the 2-year TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.579 % and 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.433 % narrowed to 24.7 basis points , its flattest since 2007 , prompting concerns of an imminent inversion .
But Detrick stressed that there have been periods with a relatively flat yield curve that have lasted years before a recession occurred , most notably in the mid to late 1990s .
And even if the yield curve does invert at some point , stock investors will have plenty of time to adjust their portfolios before the worst of the damage is done . "
Contrary to what many people think , inverted yield curves do nt always sound the alarm to sell .
In fact , looking at the past five recessions , the S&P 500 did nt peak for more than 19 months on average after the yield curve inverted , along the way adding more than 22 % on average at the peak , " he said in a report .
The chatter about narrowing spreads comes at a sensitive time for the stock market , which is banking on strong corporate earnings to overcome trade - war related jitters .
But Detrick believes the economy is too healthy for investors to worry about an imminent contraction . "
We remain positive on the economy thanks to the benefits of fiscal policy , government spending , and financial deregulation , " he said .
As such , Detrick does not expect a recession in the next 12 to 18 months .
The stock market rose Tuesday on the back of solid earnings from the corporate sector and thanks to reassurances from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the central bank will remain flexible about its monetary policy .
The S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % rose 0.4 % while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % gained 0.2 % and the Nasdaq added 0.6 % to close at a record .
The 10-year yield traded at 2.862 % and the 2-year note yield traded at 2.615 % , its highest since July 30 , 2008 , according to WSJ Market Data Group .

Andrew Joseph Cristiano Ronaldo spent the past nine seasons with Real Madrid where he won two La Liga and four Champions League titles .
The 33-year - old Portuguese superstar is moving on in a massive transfer to Juventus of Italy 's Serie A. On Tuesday , the much - speculated move became official and Ronaldo posted an open letter to fans on Real Madrid 's site .
He wrote : These years at Real Madrid and in this city of Real Madrid have quite possibly be the happiest years of my life .
I only have feelings of great gratitude to this club , to the fans and to the city .
I can only give thanks to all of them for the love and affection that I have received .
However , I feel that the time has come to begin a new stage of my life and that is why I have asked the club to accept my transfer .
I feel it this way and I am asking everyone , and especially my fans , to please understand me .
These have been nine of the most absolutely marvelous years .
These have been nine unique years .
This for me has been a very emotional time , full of deliberating , although difficult because Real Madrid is at a very demanding and high level but I know very well that I will never forget that here I have enjoyed football in a unique way .
I have had fabulous teammates , both on the field and in the dressing room .
I have felt the warmth of an incredible fan base and together we have conquered three straight Champions Leagues titles and four Champions League titles over five years .
And together with them in addition , on an individual level , I have had the satisfaction of having won four Ballons d'Or and three Golden Boots , all during my tenure at this most immense and extraordinary club .
Real Madrid has won my heart and that of my family and it is because of that , now more than ever , I would like to say thank you .
Thank you to the club , to the President , to the directors , to my teammates , to all the staff , the doctors , the physios and all the incredible people who work there in each of their capacities and who pay tireless attention to every little detail .
Infinite thanks once more to our supporters and thanks also to Spanish football .
During these nine exciting years I have come up against great players .
My respect and recognition to all of them .
I have thought a lot and I know that the moment has come for a new cycle .
I am leaving but I will always feel that this jersey , this badge and the Santiago Bernabeu are mine , no matter where I am .
Thanks to everyone and , of course , as I said the first time in our stadium nine years ago : !
Hala Madrid !

Striker Nikola Kalinic was sent home back in June after he refused to come on as a substitute late in the opening group stage match against Nigeria .
Manager Zlatko Dalic said that Kalinic 's reluctance to enter matches and participate in training was a recurring issue , so he needed players who were fit for World Cup action .
The decision forced Kalinic to watch the surprising run to the World Cup final from home , and now , soccer fans have essentially declared Kalinic the unluckiest player from this World Cup .
Croatia is one win away from the nation 's first World Cup title .

Andrew Joseph It 's almost difficult to believe that we can be in 2018 with FIFA still having no idea how to properly protect its players from head injuries .
But here we are , and it keeps happening .
During Tuesday 's World Cup semifinal match between France and Belgium , France 's Blaise Matuidi took a brutal shot to the head area from Eden Hazard .
He remained on the ground - clearly dazed - while the medical staff responded .
After a two - minute delay , Matuidi was allowed to remain in the match .
ESPN 's Taylor Twellman - a vocal critic of FIFA 's negligent approach to head trauma - called out FIFA for the scary incident .
Matuidi left the field for several seconds before returning .
After playing for an additional minute , he collapsed on the field and was substituted from the game .
FIFA does have a six - step concussion protocol , which clearly was not followed on Tuesday .
It takes longer than a two - minute delay to properly diagnose a concussion .
Concussion expert Chris Nowinski also tweeted a video of the incident , saying he was " very tired of this . "
Matuidi would remain at the bench area for the remainder of the match .

Andrew Joseph Kevin Durant has been known to spar with random fans on social media , particularly during the offseason .
His burner - account incident has n't changed that ... neither has a second NBA Finals MVP , apparently .
On Tuesday , Durant took issue with an Instagram post from the account , bucketscenter , which is run by teenager Kalyb Champion .
Champion had posted a photo of Durant , Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis with the caption , " 3 elite two way players but do n't elevate a team quite like LeBron and Steph due to their playmaking / leadership deficiencies . "
Durant was tagged in the post and jumped into Champion 's comments .
Durant wrote : " Bruh go sweep ya dorm room , u do n't know hoops .
Stop tagging me in this trash " The Warriors star evidently was n't done .
Champion would later post screenshots of direct messages from Durant 's account .
Durant called Champion a " middle school / knock off stephen a. " When Champion called Durant insecure , Durant continued the argument . (
Multiple photos in the Instagram post ) Durant eventually apologized for his Stephen A. Smith remark , but there 's still no reason for Kevin Durant to waste time and energy engaging every Instagram post that offends him .
He 's an NBA superstar , and there will be fans who dislike him for no reason at all .
It 's a pointless exercise for Durant to argue every perceived slight to his basketball career in Instagram comments and DMs .
Plus , there are definitely more enjoyable ways to spend a post - championship offseason .

Antoinette Kunda was nt always rushing to make deliveries for strangers and pick up riders .
Prior to the Great Recession , she worked as an executive administrative assistant at American Express AXP , -1.47 % , where she earned $ 80,000 a year , or approximately $ 6,667 a month .
Today , she works in the gig economy . "
I do not consider myself having a primary job , " Kunda said .
She works for Uber , Lyft , Postmates , Instacart , DoorDash , Grubhub and various other on - demand delivery and rideshare apps . "
My primary job is putting a roof over my head , " she said . "
The government reported a sharp rise in wages in August , but Antoinette Kundas income is notoriously unpredictable . "
Also see : U.S. adds 201,000 jobs as worker wages accelerate to nine - year high Her current goal is to make $ 5,000 a month but , in reality , she said she is lucky if she can pocket $ 100 a day or $ 2,800 a month .
Last week , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a sharp rise in wages in December reaching a post - recession high of 3.9 % , but Kundas income is notoriously unpredictable , which means she often has to work longer hours than when she had her 9 to 5 office job .
Yet , all of her work and the work of other so - called " side hustlers " or " gig workers " who typically take on multiple jobs , is essentially invisible in the eyes of the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics .
Though the agency is a key source of information about the labor market , it does nt keep tabs on how much people make in what the government calls " non - primary work . "
Antoinette Kunda , who works multiple gig jobs .
Antoinette Kunda On Monday , The Wall Street Journal reported on a new study , citing gig - economy experts who say economists have overestimated its impact on the U.S. economy . "
Alan Krueger of Princeton University and Lawrence Katz of Harvard sifted through new evidence to explain how , in a 2015 survey , they overestimated how people cobbling together a living from odd jobs , especially via apps like Uber , would upend traditional work arrangements , " the paper said .
That s a problem because the gig economy matters .
All that missing data could help economists understand the state of our economy and the changing nature of the workforce , and -- in a climate of stagnant wage growth -- shed more light on how much money people earn .
Its also crucial for policy makers who may seek to enact minimum wage and overtime pay laws for workers .
These laws could help drivers who are struggling to make ends meet , said Harry Campbell , who runs a blog advising drivers called the Rideshare Guy and currently drives for Uber and Lyft . "
A lot of drivers are living paycheck to paycheck and they know they need to make $ 100 each day , " he said .
Having reliable wage data helps lawmakers , companies and workers make plans . "
It tells us how the economy is doing and how much money people are going to be spending , " said Aparna Mathur , a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute , a conservative think tank in Washington D.C. " Tracking the labor market is key to everything else in the economy because it informs investment decisions , " she said .
Harry Campell , founder of the ' Rideshare Guy blog .
Harry Campbell There is no agreed upon definition of the gig economy Its tough to measure something when no one can agree on what s being measured .
The BLS does not have an explicit definition for a gig worker , or a formal way of tracking them .
It comes closest in a survey called the Contingent Worker Supplement , which studies " contingent workers " in temporary working arrangements that they do nt expect to last more than a year .
But prior to last month , the BLS had not released the Contingent Worker Supplement since 2005 due in large part to a lack of funding .
The most recent report found that 5.9 million people or 3.8 % of all workers are contingent workers .
See also : If the economy is so great , why are 78 million hustling for dimes ? "
Its not that the BLS does nt care about secondary work , they do , " said Demetra Nightingale , an economist at the Urban Institute , a think tank based in Washington D.C. But without adequate funding it is difficult for the BLS to study those workers , she said .
These workers come in many forms .
They include side hustlers with regular jobs and freelancers who take on extra clients on their off - hours , according to Freelancing in America , a 2017 survey conducted in part by Freelancers Union .
That survey estimated that 57.3 million Americans are freelancing , or 36 % of the workforce , but those freelancing could be choppy and not well paid .
America 's Changing Workforce : Independent and Gig Workers Other estimates say the gig economy is even larger than that .
The Federal Reserve has a very broad definition of people working in the gig economy .
The Fed says gig workers could be anyone from a babysitter to an Uber driver .
According to that definition , there are as many as 75 million gig workers .
Lawrence Mishel , a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute and former president of the left - leaning- pro - labor think tank , said its important to avoid using broad definitions of gig workers that risk overstating the number of gig workers and their ability to impact the economy . "
Many reporters wrongfully equate gig work with the work of independent contractors , " he said . "
Then some people , including the Federal Reserve , refer to gig work as informal work which is anything you do to make a buck . "
The Bureau of Labor Statistics is trying to get better estimates Another reason for the lack of certainty with the government estimates : There are big gaps in the Contingent Worker Supplement .
The survey only asks questions about an individuals main job , whether its full - time or part - time , and gathers no information about wages and hours worked for non - primary work . "
The fundamental basic question we ask in the CWS is did you do any work for profit , " said Karen Kosanovich , an economist at the BLS . "
If you did any work last week then you have a job . "
To better gauge the extent of the gig economy the BLS included four new questions in the May 2017 Contingent Worker Supplement , which is currently being evaluated and will be released in September 2018 .
That s in addition to the 240 questions on previous versions of the CWS .
The amount of questions respondents answer varies significantly depending upon the individuals current working circumstances .
On average , the BLS estimates that it takes respondents nine minutes to complete the questionnaire .
The four new questions are : Did you earn income through a short in - person task using a website or app last week ? "
Was that for your main job , your second job , or other additional work for pay ? "
Did you perform any work for pay " through companies that maintain lists that are accessed through an app or a website ? "
Was that work for your main job , second job or additional work for pay ?
None of the questions ask respondents the number of hours they work or the wages they earn in completing these types of jobs . (
If this was their main job , the wage data would appear in the Current Population Survey , which is used to determine the monthly unemployment and wage rate . )
And if it is not their main job ? "
The sample size would be too small , " said Julie Hatch Maxfield , assistant commissioner from the Office of Current Employment Analysis at the BLS .
She said people who take on gig work are typically supplementing their income from their primary job .
As a result , the BLS can not say for certain how many Uber drivers exist in the U.S. " The BLS is missing a lot of these workers who do nt think of themselves as having a primary job , " Mathur said .
And that s why " people are telling them to ask more specific questions to understand what is considered non - traditional work . "
Meanwhile , Antoinette Kunda feels like all her hard work goes largely unrecorded by economists . "
The government does nt have a freaking clue about the work that I do , " she said . (

AP ATLANTA ( AP ) -- A rejuvenated Marcus Stroman outlasted Julio Teheran by forcing the Braves to consistently hit grounders .

Russell Martin 's sharp single in Toronto 's five - run eighth drove in the go - ahead run , Stroman pitched seven strong innings , and the Blue Jays beat Atlanta 6 - 2 on Tuesday night to knock the Braves out of first place .
Stroman ( 2 - 6 ) frustrated the Braves by mixing his cutter and slider and recording 14 of his 21 outs on the ground . "
When I 'm pairing the cutter and slider it makes it pretty hard on the hitters , " Stroman said .
Stroman said he has felt strong since returning from the disabled list on June 23 .
The Blue Jays have won three of his four starts since he missed six weeks with right shoulder fatigue . "
It was an outstanding effort , " Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said . "

AP BRIDGEVIEW , Ill. ( AP ) -- David Accam scored in the 95th minute , and Cory Burke had two goals to help the Philadelphia Union beat the Chicago Fire 4 - 3 on Wednesday night .
Accam dribbled through a pair of Chicago defenders and sent home a right - footed shot just inside the left post for his first goal of the season .
His game - winner came a minute after the Fire appeared to have salvaged a draw with Bastian Schweinsteiger heading home Diego Campos ' corner .
Burke scored on a rebound in the 73rd minute that made it 3 - 2 for the Union ( 7 - 9 - 3 ) and a header at the end of first - half stoppage time that made it 2 - 1 .
Aleksandar Katai made it 2-all for the Fire ( 6 - 9 - 5 ) in the 69th minute with a low hard shot that skipped twice into the far corner .
Nemanja Nikolic tied it at 1 for Chicago in the 39th minute , powering a penalty kick past goalkeeper Andre Blake .
Mark McKenzie brought Katai down at the left corner of the penalty area to send Nikolic to the spot .
Haris Medunjanin opened the scoring for Philadelphia in the 31st minute , pouncing on a defensive miscue and finishing with the outside of his foot .
AP CHARLOTTE , N.C. ( AP ) -- While new Carolina Panthers owner David Tepper would like the focus to be on his plans for the team 's future , he can not completely put the franchise 's sullied past behind him .
Tepper has to keep the prominent statue of Panthers ' founder Jerry Richardson outside of the stadium as part of the NFL - record $ 2.2 billion deal he agreed to in June after Richardson decided to sell the team in December amid reports of sexual and racial misconduct in the workplace .
Tepper said Tuesday when he was introduced as the team 's new owner that he 's " contractually obligated " to keep the 13-foot high statue of Richardson standing alongside two growling panthers where it is .
The league substantiated the allegations against Richardson following a six - month investigation and fined him $ 2.75 million .
Fans have expressed their desire on social media and sports talk shows to remove the statue , which was built in 2016 .
And while Tepper said contractually he ca n't do that , he spoke repeatedly about changing the environment of the Panthers workplace .
Tepper said there will be " no impediment " in employees feeling comfortable coming forward if they if they have any problems on the business side of the organization .
He wants to create an environment where " everybody feels safe like a family . "
Sports Illustrated reported in December , citing unnamed sources , that Richardson made sexually suggestive comments to women and on at least one occasion directed a racial slur at an African - American Panthers scout .
The report states that he reached settlements that included non - disclosure requirements forbidding the parties from discussing the details . "
Listen , whatever was , was .
This is now , " Tepper said . "
This is going to be an open place .
So there are not going to be non - disclosure agreements , no matter what , in this new place .
That was then , this is now . "
The Panthers are only tied to Charlotte through June 2019 in terms of a stadium agreement , but Tepper reiterated the city is " the most logical place " to keep the team , although adding that a " redo " is necessary .
The Panthers and the city of Charlotte came to an agreement on improvements for the team 's stadium in 2013 , calling for the city to contribute about $ 87 million for renovations to Bank of America Stadium in exchange for a six - year hard tether to keep the NFL franchise in Charlotte .
Tepper 's focus right now is on new practice facilities .
He said the Panthers are " falling behind a little bit " other teams in the league .
He is considering moving the team 's practice facilities to South Carolina , in part to keep both states interested in the team .
The Panthers currently practice on three fields within walking distance to their downtown stadium .
Tepper said that valuable land could be used for developmental purposes .
Tepper , who grew up playing football , also said he wants more events at the team 's stadium , including high school state championship football games and the " right kind of concerts . "
He is excited about the football side of the team , praising two - time AP Coach of the Year Ron Rivera and his hiring of new offensive coordinator Norv Turner to replace Mike Shula . "
I 'm not looking to do too much there , " Tepper said of the coaching side .
However , Tepper plans to hire a new team president to replace Danny Morrison , who left last year , and former COO Tina Becker , who resigned on Monday after seven months in the position .
He said he has two replacement candidates in mind , both with some marketing background .
He also likes the makeup of the team 's roster with training camp right around the corner , citing how involved players are in the community and charity work .
He cited Spider - Man , saying that " with great power comes great responsibility . " _ _ _

Fowler ) has been working to get that feel , so that 's something to build on , " manager Mike Matheny said . "
Just some big days all around .
A big day for Kolten , getting four hits and the ball jumping for him , too . "
Fowler lofted his sixth homer this season , but first since May 6 , to cap the Cardinals ' seven - run sixth .

Fowler entered batting just .167 -- and .111 in his previous 20 games . "
It 's awesome , especially when you 've been scuffling at the plate trying to get timing and stuff , " he said . "
You get a pitch and you barrel it up , it feels good . "
Wong is batting only .221 this season , but has 10 hits in his last 18 at - bats .
He said the surge is a result of working on swing mechanics with hitting coach John Mabry . "
I 'm not really worried about my swing , " Wong said . "

Willis misunderstood the message , believing he had used Otero 's nickname of " O - T. " " When I saw O - T coming through the gate , it 's not that I do n't think he can pitch , but it just was n't the guy I was expecting , " Francona said . "
We had a communication ( error ) .
That one lands squarely on me , no getting around it .
I know Carl is beating himself up right now , but that one lands on me . "
Willis , who rejoined the staff this season , accepted responsibility for the mistake .
He noted that Votto was 0 of 4 in his career against Otero , but said he should have asked Francona for clarification .
Allen ( 2 - 4 ) initiated the sequence by loading the bases after recording two outs in relief of Bauer , who struck out 12 in eight shutout innings .
Cleveland 's bullpen entered the day with the third - highest ERA in baseball at 5.13 . "
Quite frankly , heart of hearts , I felt like Cody was going to get out of the situation , " Willis said . "
But you know , I made the mistake , got the wrong guy up .
It 's not that O - T ca n't get the job done , but it probably was n't the best matchup . "
Adam Duvall also doubled in a pair in the ninth , while Jose Peraza and Eugenio Suarez had RBI singles off Allen .
Cincinnati 's final seven batters reached base before Scooter Gennett ran into the third out on Suarez 's hit . "
I take sole responsibility for everything that took place there , " said Allen , who was charged with a career - high six runs . "
We 're confident in every guy that runs out of that gate and we should n't have been in that position in the first place . "
Making his first start since being named to his first All - Star Game , Bauer only allowed three singles and did n't surrender a hit until Jesse Winker 's one - out liner up the middle in the fifth .
The right - hander became the second major leaguer to post seven consecutive quality starts with eight - or - more strikeouts and no homers allowed , according to the Indians .
Pedro Martinez holds the record with eight in 2002 . "
Bauer was a handful for us and we ended up scoring all of our runs when he exited the game , " Votto said . "
There is a reason why he 's an All - Star and there is a reason why he is fastly becoming one of the better pitchers , if not one of the best pitchers in the game . "
Former Cleveland reliever Kyle Crockett ( 1 - 0 ) netted the final two outs in the eighth after righty Sal Romano went the first 7 1/3 innings .
Raisel Iglesias worked the ninth for his second save in two nights and his 19th of the season .
Francisco Lindor hit his fifth leadoff homer of the year and fellow All - Star Jose Ramirez had a solo shot for the Indians .
Ramirez ' home run was his 25th , marking the eighth time in franchise history the milestone has been reached in the first half of the season .
VERY MEMORABLE Reds interim manager Jim Riggleman earned his 700th career win , but was unaware of it until after the game .
Cincinnati is 38 - 36 since he took over for Bryan Price on April 19 . "
This is really an energetic , high - energy group , a fun - to - manage group , " he said . "
It was on display at its best right there .
That 's probably the best inning I 've been involved in for a long time . "
The four - run comeback in the ninth was the Reds ' first since June 30 , 2006 against the Indians .
TRAINER 'S ROOM Reds : RHP Homer Bailey ( right knee ) reported no physical issues after throwing two innings out of the bullpen Sunday in a rehab assignment with Triple - A Louisville .
Indians : OF Lonnie Chisenhall ( left calf ) will miss 8 - 10 weeks after a second medical opinion confirmed a Grade 3 strain .
He was placed on the disabled list on July 3 .
UP NEXT Reds RHP Tyler Mahle ( 7 - 6 , 3.66 ERA ) takes on Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco ( 9 - 5 , 4.28 ERA ) in the three - game series finale .
Mahle has n't lost since May 20 , going 4 - 0 in eight starts , and has an NL - low 2.04 ERA since June 1 . _ _ _

AP COLUMBIA , S.C. ( AP ) -- South Carolina is changing its approach this season , turning to its deep group of guards to keep the four - time Southeastern Conference Tournament champions on top .
Coach Dawn Staley led the team to a national title in 2017 , largely with a run of players like Alaina Coates and last year 's consensus national player of the year A'ja Wilson .
But with the 6-foot-5 Wilson excelling as a WNBA rookie in Las Vegas , Staley 's most experienced and talented players start in the backcourt . "
We 'll look a little different , " Staley said . "
But , hopefully , we 'll have the same results . "
There is no natural successor to Wilson , the dynamic All - American who set the school 's career scoring mark .
So Staley is counting on experienced guard play from returning veterans like Tyasha Harris and Bianca Cuevas - Moore and first - year transfers like Te'a Cooper from Tennessee and Nelly Perry from Clemson .
Opponents will likely see three guards in the lineup much of the time next season .
Staley , a former point guard who led the United States to three Olympic gold medals , has toyed with four - guard lineups to take advantage of what she believes is the team 's improved quickness . "
We have a lot of options , " Staley said . "
We can go positional with three guards , we can go small with four guards . "
Harris was a freshman starter at the point for the national champions ; she then led the SEC in assists as a sophomore .
She will be challenged this year at the position by Cooper and Cuevas - Moore .
Cooper made the SEC all - freshman team two years ago with the Lady Vols and is eligible to play this fall after missing 2016 - 17 with injury .
She sat out last year after joining the Gamecocks due to NCAA guidelines .
Cuevas - Moore , part of the same recruiting class as Wilson that ranked No .
2 in the country , had announced her transfer to West Virginia for a final season .
But after her graduation , Staley reached out and discovered Cuevas - Moore was not locked into leaving .
The coach and player have not always seen eye - to - eye , but they continued talking and Cuevas - Moore will finish her college career where it began .
Staley is confident Cuevas - Moore can play like the lead guard she envisioned when she first recruited her . "
She 's ready to take that next step , " Staley said .
Perry may be the most surprising addition to the Gamecocks .
She played three seasons with Staley 's former college teammate and good friend Audra Smith at Clemson , where Perry was the leading scorer two years ago .
But she missed last season with a shoulder injury .
When Smith was let go by the Tigers -- Smith is now coach at South Carolina State -- Perry joined the Gamecocks as a graduate transfer .
Staley said Perry 's biggest role will be providing leadership lost with Wilson 's departure . "
When you lose someone like A'ja , you want in some other way to gain some experience in the locker room , " the coach said .
Add senior Doniyah Cliney and sophomores Bianca Jackson and Lele Grissett to the guard mix while South Carolina 's top newcomers are guards in Victaria Saxton and McDonald 's All - American Destanni Henderson . "
I 'm just excited , " Staley said , " because all of them are a lot different than each other . "
AP DENVER ( AP ) -- Tyler Anderson kept Arizona in check for six innings .
Once he left , the Diamondbacks pounced on the Colorado Rockies bullpen .
David Peralta and A.J. Pollock homered in Arizona 's four - run seventh inning , and the Diamondbacks beat the Rockies 5 - 3 on Tuesday night . "
It 's good when you do something to help the team to win , " said Peralta , who has 16 home runs . "
You have to be ready for a mistake .
I was trying to slow down the game .
I was really happy . "
Nick Ahmed also went deep as the Diamondbacks won for ninth straight time at Coors Field .
Arizona managed just three hits off Anderson but a high pitch count ended his night early .
The Diamondbacks roughed up the Rockies ' bullpen in the seventh .
Jake McGee ( 1 - 3 ) walked Jeff Mathis , allowed a double to pinch - hitter Chris Owings before Peralta hit the first strike he saw into the seats in right to give the Diamondbacks a 4 - 2 lead . "
I threw two bad pitches with my secondary pitches , " McGee said . "
The second one I got it up too much to Peralta .
You are going to pay when that happens . "
Pollock hit a solo homer later in the inning off Scott Oberg .
The big inning wasted another strong outing for Anderson .
He has allowed just one run in his last three starts , two of which have come at Coors Field .
He has a 0.45 ERA since losing to the Miami Marlins on June 23rd .
He walked four batters Tuesday , two leading off the third inning but came back to strike out the side and leave the runners stranded . "
I was working fast , too fast , " Anderson said . "
I stayed back and made good pitches .
A lot of times when you 're back is against the wall , you have to do that . "
Nolan Arenado hit his 23rd homer off Archie Bradley in the bottom of the seventh , tying him for the NL lead in that category .
The Rockies put the tying run on first but Andrew Chafin retired the last two batters to end the threat .
Randall Delgado ( 2 - 0 ) tossed 1 2/3 innings in relief of Patrick Corbin to get the win .
Brad Boxberger pitched the ninth for his 22nd save .
Corbin went only 4 1/3 innings and failed to pitch at least five innings for the first time this season .
The left - hander came into the game with a 0.95 ERA in his previous three starts . "
I did n't go as deep into the game as I 'd like , " Corbin said . "
Just a couple of mistakes and got my pitch count early .
I was hoping to get through the fifth there but the bullpen came up huge . "
TRAINER 'S ROOM Diamondbacks : RHP Clay Buchholz ( left oblique strain ) threw a bullpen on Tuesday while INF Deven Marrero ( left oblique strain ) continues to do range - of - motion exercises .
Rockies : OF David Dahl ( broken right foot ) took batting practice Wednesday .
Dahl has been out since June 1 after fouling a ball off his foot against San Francisco .
HOME AWAY FROM HOME Arizona 's nine straight wins at Coors Field are a franchise record at an away ballpark .
The Diamondbacks have n't lost in Denver since June 20 , 2017 . "
You come up here and we 're ready to play our best baseball , " manager Torey Lovullo said . "
For the first five innings we looked like we were semi - sleepwalking but the right guys came up when we needed them . "
Arizona had an eight - game winning streak at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia snapped in April .
ROSTER MOVE The Rockies activated C Tom Murphy from the paternity list and optioned INF Jordan Patterson to Triple - A Albuquerque .
UP NEXT Diamondbacks RHP Shelby Miller ( 0 - 3 , 9.00 ) makes his fourth start Wednesday since returning from Tommy John surgery .
He will face Colorado RHP German Marquez ( 7 - 8 , 4.92 ) , who is 2 - 0 with a 1.29 ERA with 14 strikeouts and no walks in his last two starts . _ _ _

AP DORTMUND , Germany ( AP ) -- Morocco right back Achraf Hakimi is joining Borussia Dortmund on a two - year loan from Real Madrid .
Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc says , " Hakimi is a young , very dynamic outside defender , who has already played at the highest level for the Moroccan national team and Real Madrid . "
The 19-year - old Hakimi made nine appearances in the Spanish league and played in two Champions League games for Real Madrid last season .
He has made 13 appearances for Morocco , and was part of its World Cup team in Russia .
Hakimi is Dortmund 's latest signing this offseason after Thomas Delaney ( from Werder Bremen ) , Marius Wolf ( Eintracht Frankfurt ) , Abdou Diallo ( Mainz ) , Marwin Hitz ( Augsburg ) and Eric Oelschlaegel ( Werder Bremen ) .
Also , Andriy Yarmolenko has left Dortmund for West Ham , which is paying a reported 20 million euros ( $ 23.5 million ) for the Ukraine winger .
AP EL SEGUNDO , Calif. ( AP ) -- Lance Stephenson always felt his famed rivalry with LeBron James was rooted in mutual respect .
When James called Stephenson last week to pitch him on teaming up with the Los Angeles Lakers , Stephenson 's feelings were confirmed -- and he quickly accepted the invitation .
The Lakers formally announced the signings of Stephenson , center JaVale McGee and second - round draft pick Svi Mykhailiuk on Tuesday .
Coming off a productive season in his latest stint with the Indiana Pacers , Stephenson agreed to a one - year , $ 4.5 million deal to join James , McGee and Rajon Rondo in the Lakers ' influx of veteran talent .
Stephenson has been one of James ' most famed antagonists during their careers , and even Stephenson is surprised they 've become teammates .
But it only took a phone call from LeBron to persuade Stephenson to join the Lakers . "
I was actually surprised he made the move to LA , " Stephenson said . "
I guess he needed a new look , and I just feel like him reaching out and showing he likes what I bring to the game , it 's amazing .
I 'm just happy to be on a team that wants to win . "
Stephenson and James competed fiercely in the Eastern Conference over the years , with Stephenson applying tough defense and creative tactics to the four - time NBA Most Valuable Player .
Stephenson created multiple memes during the 2014 East finals between the Pacers and James ' Miami Heat by blowing in James ' ear and making a famously exaggerated flop . "
It 's actually funny that I 'm actually on the same team as him , " Stephenson said . "
I 'm very excited to see what that brings .
Just playing with him , one of the best players in the game , I ca n't wait to get on board with him and have a fun season this year . "
Stephenson appeared in all 82 games for Indiana last season , averaging 9.2 points , 5.2 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game .
The Lakers are his seventh NBA franchise entering his ninth season .
Stephenson is eager to run with the up - tempo Lakers and their young core , including Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball . "
It 's going to be amazing , " Stephenson said . "
Especially playing with the talent I 'm playing with , the high tempo , just playing without thinking too much and playing in the flow of the game and having fun at the same time , a team that run and guns , that 's basically how I love to play . "
McGee joins the Lakers from the Golden State Warriors , where he won his second straight NBA championship ring .
The 7-foot veteran could be the starting center for the Lakers , who have only young big men Moe Wagner and Ivica Zubac under contract after allowing Brook Lopez to leave . "
JaVale changes the geometry of the game , " general manager Rob Pelinka said . "
His unique combination of incredible length and foot nimbleness will allow us to play fast at both ends .
His ability to both protect the rim and create angles with rim rolls will present a number of advantages in coach ( Luke ) Walton 's system . "
The Lakers chose Mykhailiuk with the 47th overall pick in last month 's draft .
The Ukrainian shooter averaged 14.6 points , 3.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game for Kansas last season while setting the Jayhawks ' single - season record with 115 3-pointers .
Mykhailiuk has been impressive early in Las Vegas summer league play , and the Lakers decided they did n't need to wait to sign him later in the offseason . _ _ _

AP EL SEGUNDO , Calif. ( AP ) -- Rob Pelinka says the Los Angeles Lakers are n't trying to beat the Golden State Warriors at their own game .
Instead , they 're building a team around LeBron James to do something different .
Pelinka spoke publicly Wednesday for the first time since the Lakers ' remarkable offseason overhaul began , and the irrepressibly optimistic former agent radiated excitement about the future for a team that has n't made the playoffs in five seasons . "
To get the commitment from LeBron James to come to the Lakers for four years was really the culmination of everything we 've been working towards , " Pelinka said . "
When LeBron chose to come here , it was the ultimate validation for the moves we 've made and what we 've been building since we started . "
The longest postseason drought in franchise history could be finished after James chose the Lakers in free agency .
The club also added veterans Rajon Rondo , JaVale McGee and Lance Stephenson alongside their young core while parting ways with Julius Randle and Brook Lopez , among others .
Pelinka and top executive Magic Johnson hope the result is a sturdy , defense - minded team with enough up - tempo offense to trouble the Warriors , the Houston Rockets and every other contender for the title . "
I think to try to play the Warriors at their own game is a trap , " Pelinka said . "
No one is going to beat them at their own game , so that is why we wanted to add these elements of defense and toughness and depth and try to look at areas where we will have an advantage . "
Pelinka said the Lakers focused their free agency recruitment efforts on versatile , playoff - tested talents who can score and defend , instead of looking for elite players with only one specialty .
He hopes the result will be a flexible , dangerous team under coach Luke Walton -- and a different look around James , whose Cleveland Cavaliers teams often looked like a collection of perimeter shooters whose deficiencies were exposed by Golden State and others .
Pelinka praised Rondo as a gritty guard whose championship pedigree will fill a void on the roster .
He also described Stephenson as providing " an extreme toughness and an edge , " comparing his skills to Dennis Rodman 's contributions to Michael Jordan 's Chicago Bulls , or Metta World Peace 's work with Kobe Bryant 's late - career Lakers . "
The road to the NBA championship has to go through the team that won last year , and we all know the guys up north have a special group , " Pelinka said . "
But one of the ways to attack what they have is with defensive toughness .
I think we saw that in the Houston series with some of the players that Houston has . "
Pelinka 's desire for flexibility extended to the payroll as well .
After years of trading away draft picks and acquiring high - priced veterans in an effort to win now with Bryant , the Lakers were overextended until Pelinka and Johnson spent the past 16 months creating enough salary cap space to sign two elite free agents .
They only got one , although the Lakers still appear to be in contention for disgruntled San Antonio star Kawhi Leonard , who has a year left on his contract with the Spurs .
No matter what happens , Pelinka said the Lakers ' series of one - year contracts around James will put them in position to have ample cap space again next summer , when several stars could be available to join James .
Pelinka said the Lakers will have " an open training camp " in September , with only James guaranteed to be a starter .
That means Rondo and second - year pro Lonzo Ball will compete to be Los Angeles ' starting point guard , a possibility that was welcomed by Rondo after he signed .
Pelinka also said Ball will be fully healthy for training camp .
The point guard has a torn meniscus in his left knee .
Pelinka 's idiosyncrasies shone through again Wednesday , with the GM beginning his news conference by reading a passage from Brazilian author Paulo Coelho 's " The Alchemist , " a book recommended to him by former client Bryant and carried by James throughout the playoffs .
The passage describes the process of making a decision being " only the beginning of things . " "
Hopefully it will lead to things ... happening that are bigger than our dreams could ever imagine , " Pelinka said . _ _ _

He declined to release specifics .
Van Horn 's current contract runs through the 2021 season , with an annual base package of $ 775,000 .
The 57-year - old Van Horn , who 's 643 - 364 at Arkansas , spoke to reporters prior to an appearance at a Razorback Club event in Harrison .

AP HARRISON , N.J. ( AP ) -- The New York Red Bulls have added C.J. Brown to the coaching staff .
The MLS club announced the hiring Tuesday with Brown filling the spot that opened when Chris Armas was elevated to head coach after Jesse Marsch resigned last week .
Brown had a 13-year pro career , including 10 seasons alongside Armas with the Chicago Fire .
Both were part of the inaugural Fire team that won the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup and MLS Cup in 1998 , and went on to win a Supporters ' Shield and three more U.S. Open Cups as teammates .
After retiring , the center back transitioned to coaching , working for Real Salt Lake , the Chicago Fire , New York City FC and Orlando City SC .
AP KANSAS CITY , Mo. ( AP ) -- Former NBA player Kermit Washington has been sentenced to six years in federal prison for spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in charity donations on vacations , shopping sprees and plastic surgery for his girlfriend .
The U.S. attorney 's office said in a news release that the 66-year - old Las Vegas man was also ordered Monday to pay nearly $ 970,000 in restitution after pleading guilty in November to making a false statement in a tax return and aggravated identity theft .
Washington played for several NBA teams in the 1970s and 1980s .
He is best known for throwing a punch that fractured Houston Rockets player Rudy Tomjanovich 's face and left him unconscious during a 1977 game .
Washington was playing for the Los Angeles Lakers at the time .
Prosecutors accused Washington of using his position as representative of the National Basketball Players Association to refer professional athletes to Ronald Jack Mix , a Pro Football Hall of Famer and San Diego lawyer who specialized in workers ' compensation cases .
Mix filed workers ' compensation cases for the athletes then donated about $ 155,000 to Washington 's charity , The Sixth Man Foundation , which did business as Project Contact Africa .
Donors were told the charity was supporting work in Africa , including a medical clinic for needy families and HIV - positive children .
In his plea , Washington admitted that he diverted that money to pay himself and for personal expenses .
He also admitted that he did n't report that income to the charity on Project Contact Africa 's IRS filings for several years .
Mix pleaded guilty in 2016 to making donations ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 25,000 for referrals of athletes and then claimed those payments as charitable contributions on his individual tax returns from 2010 to 2013 .
Washington also admitted that he accepted $ 82,025 in contributions to his charity from Reza Davachi , of Damascus , Maryland , which he also diverted for his personal use .
He also admitted that he used the identity of another person in numerous state and federal filings on behalf of the charity to perpetuate the fraud .
Washington 's case was prosecuted in Kansas City , Missouri , because some the athletes he referred to Mix lived in Missouri 's Western District .
AP LAS VEGAS ( AP ) -- It 's been a bumpy ride for Atlanta Hawks point guard Trae Young , but he finally got his shot going .
The No .
5 overall pick out of Oklahoma scored 24 points and made 7 of 13 3-pointers to help the Hawks defeat the Chicago Bulls 101 - 93 on Tuesday in the Las Vegas Summer League .
Young looked like the player who led the nation in scoring and assists as a college freshman . "
I just try to play my game , " he said . "
I try to make the right plays , and if I see an opening , I 'm going to knock it down or find my teammates .
I 'm just trying to get more into rhythm each and every game .
I 'm just trying to get better and progress and get better .
That 's my main thing .
I think I 'm headed in the right direction . "
Young made just 12 of 52 shots in three summer league games in Utah , and before Tuesday , he had shot just 29 percent in two games Las Vegas .
After showing signs of figuring things out with a 21-point , 11-assist performance against New York this past Saturday , he suffered a minor right quadriceps injury on Sunday against Portland .
He seemed fine on Tuesday , playing a team - high 33 minutes .
It 's still just July and the sample size is small , but Young 's early struggles reflect the concerns about him being too frail , short and undisciplined to succeed in the NBA .
Even in his breakout game against Chicago , he missed all six of his shots inside the 3-point line .
Young is n't the only high profile rookie point guard who has encountered rough times in Las Vegas , though .

AP LAS VEGAS ( AP ) -- Michele Roberts was unanimously re - elected Tuesday to another four - year term as executive director of the National Basketball Players Association .
Roberts first moved into the role in 2014 , about two years before the players and the league agreed on the current Collective Bargaining Agreement .
The extension means that Roberts will almost certainly be deeply involved in negotiating whatever the next CBA will look like . "
She has been nothing short of amazing , " union president Chris Paul of the Houston Rockets said .
The union was without an executive director for more than a year before Roberts got the job , and she said overcoming the skepticism of players -- who were reeling after the way Billy Hunter 's term as director came to a turbulent end -- was critical to her success . "
When I got here , the players had every reason to be as suspicious of me as they could possibly be , " Roberts said . "
They had every reason to wonder and question my motives and my ability to deliver . "
Her second term will end in 2022 , when both the players and the league can decide to opt out of the current CBA .
She said the union is already preparing for what the next CBA will look like . "
Even as you sign the last CBA , you 're preparing for the next one , " Roberts said .
AP LAS VEGAS ( AP ) -- NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is certain that changes are coming to the league .
Some are easy .
Others , not so much .
Speaking after the NBA 's Board of Governors meeting on Tuesday night , Silver said he thinks the league is ready to scrap the rule requiring players to be out of high school for a year before becoming eligible to enter the draft .
That one should be relatively simple to move forward now , while notions such as how to find more competitive balance are still a puzzler to the league and its commissioner . "
I 'm not here to say we have a problem , " Silver said . "
And I love where the league is right now .
But I think we can create a better system . "
Part of that better system , he thinks , will be reverting back to the policy that will allow players to go into the league right out of high school -- something that should be in place in time for the 2021 NBA Draft , though that timeline has not been formally announced .
Silver was a proponent of making the eligibility age older , up to 20 instead of the current 19 , though has changed his stance on that in recent weeks . "
My personal view is that we 're ready to make that change , " Silver said . "
It wo n't come immediately .
But when I 've weighed the pros and cons , given that Condoleezza Rice and her commission have recommended to the NBA that those one - and - done players now come directly into the league and in essence the college community is saying ' We do not want those players anymore , ' I think that tips the scale in my mind . "
Michele Roberts , the National Basketball Players Association 's newly re - elected executive director -- the players ' union announced a new four - year deal for her earlier Tuesday -- has had talks with Silver on the topic , though she stopped short of revealing specifics .
Any change to the rule will require that the league 's Collective Bargaining Agreement will have to be amended . "
Stay tuned , " Roberts said , adding , " I suspect that we 'll have some news in the next few months . "
Now that Silver is on board , that switch should be painless .
So , too , will be a relatively minor tweak to free agency rules , that being a likely change to what has been the traditional 12:01 a.m. EDT start time on July 1 .
Silver said he 's no fan of the all - night news cycle that has accompanied the official start of free agency , and without divulging what will happen he made clear that it 'll be different for 2019 .
But creating parity , that one is n't going to be simple .
Golden State has won three of the last four NBA championships , and this summer saw the Warriors land DeMarcus Cousins for a $ 5.3 million -- a mere pittance by NBA standards for an All - Star , even one recovering from an Achilles ' tear .
LeBron James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers , which will likely make the loaded Western Conference even more competitive .
Making the playoffs out West will probably be much tougher than getting there out of the East . "
It 's on me and our labor relations committee ultimately to sit with the players and their committee and convince them that there may be a better way of doing things , " Silver said . "
By that , meaning change ultimately in the Collective Bargaining Agreement . ...
I do n't necessarily think it 's , per se , bad that the Warriors are so dominant .
We 're not trying to create some sort of forced parity .
What we 're really focused on is parity of opportunity . "
Roberts said she sees no shortage of good teams in the league . "
Competitive balance , it kind of almost depends upon what your favorite team is , " Roberts said . "
I do n't hear anyone in the Bay Area worrying about competitive balance .
I also do n't hear people in Philadelphia worrying about competitive balance , or Houston .
We 've got great teams .
It 's never been the case that I was not able , most of the time , be able to predict who was going to be in the finals . "
Among other matters Silver addressed Tuesday : -- The governors were briefed on the ongoing talks the league is having with the gaming industry , with sports betting now able to be offered by each state following a ruling in May by the U.S. Supreme Court . --
Silver called it " embarrassing " that the league currently has only one female referee , and said he 's hopeful that will be changed before long .
There are 19 female referees at summer league in Las Vegas this month . --
The investigation into allegations of workplace misconduct against the Dallas Mavericks should be completed by the end of July , Silver said .
AP LAS VEGAS ( AP ) -- Some New York Knicks fans already are reconsidering their feelings about first - round pick Kevin Knox .

A quick look at Wimbledon : LOOKAHEAD TO WEDNESDAY Roger Federer wo n't have the comforts of Centre Court to rely on as he continues his search for a record - extending ninth Wimbledon title .
Federer will play his quarterfinal against Kevin Anderson on No .
1 Court -- the first time in three years he has been scheduled away from his usual home at the All England Club .
That means he could have deal with windier conditions than usual , as No .
1 court is slightly more open to the elements .
He 's still the big favorite against Anderson , the eighth - seeded South African who is playing in his first Wimbledon quarterfinal , compared to 16 for Federer -- another record .
Federer seems to create history every time he steps on court at the grass - court Grand Slam , and would take his streak of consecutive sets won at Wimbledon to 35 if he dispatches Anderson in three straight .
That would eclipse his own record of 34 straight sets won between 2005 and 2006 .
On Centre Court , Novak Djokovic of Serbia will play Kei Nishikori Japan and Rafael Nadal of Spain will face Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina .
Djokovic and Nadal , with five titles between them , would face each other in the semifinals if both win .

Arsenal signed Uruguay defensive midfielder Lucas Torreira from Sampdoria on Tuesday .
The 22-year - old Torreira is the fourth acquisition by Arsenal since Unai Emery was appointed as coach in May. The cost and length of his contract were not disclosed .
Torreira played a part in all of Uruguay 's World Cup matches and started their quarterfinal defeat to France last Friday . "
A midfielder with great quality , I have enjoyed watching his performances for Sampdoria in the past two seasons , and we all saw him do very well for Uruguay in the World Cup , " Emery said .
Torreira follows Stephan Lichtsteiner , Bernd Leno , and Sokratis Papastathopoulos this offseason to the north London club .
In an age of tattoos , tongue piercings and tensions over Brexit , a soft - spoken man in a dark blue waistcoat and striped tie is uniting England amid dreams of victory in soccer 's World Cup .
Coach Gareth Southgate is the buttoned - down leader of a new generation of players who speak softly and let their victories silence critics .
And England supporters have found that refreshing after years of underperforming teams led by stars such as David Beckham , who became as much a celebrity as an athlete . "
He 's very much about a team spirit .
It 's more about the collective -- you can see it in the way he deals with the squad , " said Paul Willis , who was in the stands last Saturday in Samara , Russia , when England reached the semifinals with a 2 - 0 victory over Sweden . "
We had superstars , but we did n't have a team . "
Southgate 's focus on teamwork and civility has made him an unlikely icon in a country that is deeply divided by bitter arguments over plans to leave the European Union and a widening gap between rich and poor .
England Captain Harry Kane may be the tournament 's leading scorer , but fans are donning waistcoats and ties -- even as the country enjoys an unusually hot summer -- in homage to Southgate as pundits extol the 47-year - old coach 's calm leadership . "
He has shown us the value of courtesy , kindness , hard work and that most derided of virtues , niceness , " columnist India Knight wrote in the Sunday Times . "
He has redefined not just how to be a manager , but how to be a man . "
Southgate displayed his character after England 's July 3 victory over Colombia , offering a supportive hug to Colombian player Mateus Uribe after his miss in a penalty shootout helped England advance .
The England coach understood Uribe 's agony , having missed a similar shot at the 1996 European championships .
The moment of empathy also reminded the country how Southgate once lampooned his own failure with a Pizza Hut commercial in which he wore a bag over his head to shield his identity from angry fans .
Southgate 's compassion sparked a hashtag for the coach 's real and imagined acts of kindness such as " # GarethSouthgateWould stop and help you put the chain back on your bike even if he was all dressed in his waistcoat and late for the game . "
Southgate became manager less than two years ago after the Football Association 's first choice was forced out after unguarded comments to undercover reporters .
Since then he has quietly ushered out the last of the old stars and brought together a group of youngsters who modestly shrug off compliments and give kudos to their teammates .
Perhaps more importantly , he recognized the contribution of the fans , something that had been eroded during the superstar era .
After every game , Southgate and his players walk across the field to applaud the supporters who have traveled to Russia to cheer for the team . "
We had lost a bit of connection , " Willis , a 57-year - old fan from Birmingham , said of past regimes . "
That is now back .
All the team and the back room applaud our input to the game . "
That has also translated into huge support back home in football - mad England .
At least 20 million people , 38 percent of England 's population , watched Saturday 's victory over Sweden , according to figures from the BBC .
Commentators say the actual number was much higher because so many people watched the game on huge screens in parks and shopping centers .
London authorities are inviting 30,000 fans to the city 's Hyde Park for a screening of Wednesday 's semifinal against Croatia .
Fearing demand will far exceed that , authorities stressed that only those with tickets should come to the park .
Ticket services reported hundreds of people were trying to dump theater tickets for Wednesday because they had more pressing business elsewhere .
Social media sites are urging fans to wear waistcoats -- please do n't call them vests -- to the office ahead of the big match -- a " Waistcoat Wednesday " if you will .
Marks & Spencer , the official tailor to the England team , says sales of the grandfatherly garments have doubled during the World Cup .
Rio Ferdinand , one of the previous " golden generation " of players who is now a commentator for the BBC , has been leading the cheers for this year 's team , asking fans to post video of their beer - throwing , chest - bearing , flag - waving celebrations after the win over Sweden .
On Sunday , Ferdinand tweeted his own mea culpa for past failures , while also highlighting Southgate 's unique contribution . "
Why were n't the golden generation ... the golden generation ? ? ? "
he tweeted . "
We as players look at ourselves first ... we never performed .... but sometimes you have to be allowed to perform !
Gareth is allowing this current @England to do this . "
That 's paying off .
Kane , who turns 25 later this month , has scored six goals in the tournament .
Dele Alli , 22 , came back from injury to score the team 's second goal against Sweden .
Fabian Delph , 28 , played the last 15 minutes of Saturday 's game after missing the previous game against Colombia because Southgate allowed him to go home for the birth of his third child .
Southgate himself recognizes the contributions of everyone , from the physiotherapists to the players who push their teammates in practice but rarely get into a game , even to fans back home . "
Our country has been through some difficult moments recently in terms of its unity , and I think sport has the power to do that and football in particular has the power to do that , " he said . "
So for us , we can feel the energy and we can feel the support from home , and that 's , that 's a very special feeling .
It 's a privilege . "
Barring that , it does help to have a snappy waistcoat . "
Quite frankly , I do n't care what he wears , " Willis said . "
He can wear a tutu if we carry on winning . "
John Isner is ready to be associated with something at Wimbledon other than winning a 70 - 68 fifth set in the longest match in tennis history .
He figures a championship would do the trick -- and now he 's only two victories away .
Isner , a 33-year - old American playing in his 41st major tournament , reached his first Grand Slam semifinal by beating Milos Raonic 6 - 7 ( 5 ) , 7 - 6 ( 7 ) , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 at the All England Club on Wednesday .
He 'd never even been past the third round in 10 previous appearances at Wimbledon , a place he called a " house of horrors " earlier in the tournament because of all of his quick exits and five - set losses .
Isner is most famous for that record - breaking victory over Nicolas Mahut in the first round eight years ago , which lasted 11 hours , 5 minutes spread out over three days . "
Of course , everyone is going to remember that match in 2010 , and rightfully so .
I like to think that , since that match , I 've done a lot of good stuff on the court performance - wise .
But for a lot of people , that 's definitely the lasting image of my career , " said the No .
9-seeded Isner , who is based in Dallas . "
I think if I can keep going further here , I can maybe squash that . "
If the 6-foot-10 Isner he keeps serving the way he has been over the past 1 1/2 weeks , that 's a real possibility .
He hit 25 aces and saved the only break point he faced against 2016 Wimbledon runner - up Raonic , and has won all 95 service games he 's played across five matches . "
I did n't have many chances , " said Raonic , who had his right thigh taped by a trainer after feeling something akin to a muscle tear in the first set . "
Was n't necessarily anything overly surprising .
He 's been quite disciplined when he 's come forward , " the 13th - seeded Raonic said . "
I also saw he 's been doing that much better over the last weeks and months . "
It 's the second year in a row a man from the U.S. made a breakthrough at Wimbledon .
In 2017 , Sam Querrey got to his first major semifinal in his 42nd attempt , the most on record .
For Isner , Wednesday 's match was only his second Grand Slam quarterfinal .
The other came back in 2011 at the U.S. Open . "
Certainly the Grand Slam results have n't been there , " said Isner , whose wife is pregnant with their first child . "
But now I 'm sort of rectifying that , I think . "
In Friday 's semifinals , he will see a friendly face across the net in No .
8 seed Kevin Anderson , a South African who saved a match point and came all the way back to stun eight - time champion Roger Federer 2 - 6 , 6 - 7 ( 5 ) , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 , 13 - 11 . "
He showed a lot of -- what can you say ? --
gumption , I guess , " Isner said .
Isner leads Anderson 8 - 3 in head - to - head matchups on tour , but their rivalry goes back further than that .
They faced each other as college players when Isner was at Georgia , and Anderson at Illinois . "
We 've known each other forever , " Isner said . _ _ _

Juan Martin del Potro faces some major challenges if he 's going to go any further at Wimbledon after reaching consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinals for the first time since 2012 .
First , on Wednesday he 'll take to the court for a third consecutive day amid concerns over his fitness .
Second , his opponent will be two - time Wimbledon champion Rafael Nadal .
2009 U.S. Open champion Del Potro defeated Gilles Simon 7 - 6 ( 1 ) , 7 - 6 ( 5 ) , 5 - 7 , 7 - 6 ( 5 ) in a match that was carried over to Tuesday to complete the men 's quarterfinal lineup at the All England Club .
The other matchups see defending champion Roger Federer against Kevin Anderson ; Novak Djokovic takes on Kei Nishikori and Milos Raonic meets John Isner in a matchup of big servers .
After reaching the French Open semifinals last month , Del Potro -- who has missed long periods with a career - threatening left wrist injury -- returned to his career - high ranking of No .
4 for the first time since February 2014 , which he acknowledges is a " good signal " . "
I do n't know if I 'm better or not , a better player than few years ago , " said Del Potro , after returning to the last eight at Wimbledon for the first time since 2013 . "
I 'm doing a good season already .
I 'm very proud to be in the last eight players of this tournament " Del Potro 's Roland Garros run was ended by eventual champion Nadal .
If the Argentine is to make it back - to - back last four appearances , he will need to reverse that result on Wednesday . "
If I want to beat him ( Nadal ) , " Del Potro said . "
I have to come to the net very often and play hard with my forehands , with my backhands , and try to take all the chances . "
With the fifth - seeded Del Potro 's fourth - round match -- the longest men 's singles contest of the tournament so far -- having required to be finished Tuesday , he will be taking to the court for a third consecutive day .
Given the fact he withdrew from a pre - Wimbledon event with a groin concern and called the trainer during his match with Simon , Del Potro 's fitness could be a factor . "
I think I will be in good condition . "
Del Potro said . "
My body feels OK . "
There is little doubt that Nadal -- who is playing in the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the first time since 2011 -- will provide a big test .
Before Del Potro and Nadal arrive on Centre Court , three - time champion Novak Djokovic , will get the chance he 's been waiting for .
Having played three of his matches away from Centre Court , Djokovic asked after his fourth - round win over Karen Khachanov that his meeting with 24th - seeded Nishikori be played in the main stadium .
His wish was granted , meaning that top - seeded Federer will play away from Centre Court for the first time in three years .
The more gusty conditions on No .
1 Court could make Federer 's challenge against eighth - seeded Kevin Anderson more complicated .
Stretching back to last year , Federer has won 32 consecutive sets at Wimbledon and will break his previous longest streak of 34 if he wins in straight sets .
Following Federer on No .
1 Court will be the two biggest servers remaining in the tournament .
Ninth - seeded Isner has hit a tournament - high 135 aces on his way to reaching his first Wimbledon quarterfinal .
Next in the aces column is his opponent , 2016 runner - up Raonic .
The 13th - seeded Raonic has hit 117 aces en route to his fourth last - eight showing at the All England Club .
Both players said the match is likely to come down to a few crucial points , but took different tones when asked to suggest where they might have an advantage . "
I think I can move a little bit better than he can , " Raonic said .
Isner 's retort : " I 'm taller than him .
That 's all I got for you right now . " _ _ _

The 2017 French Open champion has n't lost a set en route to her last - four meeting with two - time Grand Slam winner Angelique Kerber .
The youngest remaining player in the draw , 21-year - old Ostapenko was a junior champion at Wimbledon in 2014 and has gone one step further than when she reached the quarterfinals at the All England club a year ago .
The 11th - seeded Kerber is seeking a return to the Wimbledon final and a possible rematch with Serena Williams , who beat the German in the 2016 final .

12:45 p.m. Serena Williams will attempt to reach a Grand Slam final for the 12th straight season as she faces Julia Goerges in the Wimbledon semifinals on Thursday .
When Williams took a leave of absence to have her first child soon after claiming her 23rd Grand Slam at the 2017 Australian Open , it appeared her streak might be under threat .
However , the 36-year - old American has quickly found a level of form that has carried her to within two wins of an eighth Wimbledon title .
Williams has every reason to be confident against 13th - seeded Goerges of Germany , who is playing in her first Grand Slam semifinal .
Williams has won all three of their previous encounters , with the most recent coming at the French Open last month .

The Latest from Wimbledon ( all times local ) : 8:55 p.m. Top - ranked Rafael Nadal outlasted Juan Martin del Potro in a crowd - pleasing five - set duel to reach his first Wimbledon semifinal since 2011 .
In a match filled with entertaining rallies between two of the biggest hitters in the game , Nadal came from a set down to win 7 - 5 , 6 - 7 ( 7 ) , 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 in 4 hours , 48 minutes -- the longest match of this year 's tournament .
Del Potro finished with 77 winners to Nadal 's 67 but failed to convert any of his five break points in the fifth set .
Instead it was the Spaniard who earned the only break of the decider and he closed out the win on his first match point -- leaving the fifth - seeded Argentine sprawled on the grass in exhaustion .

Djokovic rallied to hold and only lost two more games from that point onward as he advanced to his first Grand Slam semifinal since the 2016 U.S. Open .
Djokovic missed the second half of 2017 with an elbow injury , but his run at Wimbledon is the latest indicator that the 12-time Grand Slam champion is nearing his best form .

Yes , this will be Serena Williams ' 10th Wimbledon final .
Yes , it 's her 30th title match at any major .
And , well , sure , she 's widely regarded as not just the best of her era , but any era .
Let others shrug at this latest accomplishment , as if all it signified were merely another chance at another in a long line of trophies .
Williams is not shy about saying she , for one , is impressed by this .
Rightly so .
For it was only about 10 months ago she was having a baby and then dealing with a serious health scare that followed .
Even after all of that , even after more than a year away from the game , even in only the fourth tournament of her comeback , Williams showed she 's still capable of dominance .
Especially at the All England Club , where a relatively routine 6 - 2 , 6 - 4 victory over 13th - seeded Julia Goerges of Germany on Thursday put Williams one win away from an eighth championship .
She 's also closing in on her 24th Grand Slam title , which would equal Margaret Court 's all - time record . "
A lot of people were saying , ' Oh , she should be in the final , ' " the 36-year - old Williams said . "
For me it 's such a pleasure and a joy because , you know , less than a year ago , I was going through so much stuff . "
After hitting five aces with a serve that reached 119 mph , delivering 16 winners to only seven unforced errors , and covering the court so well with speed and effort , Williams will face another German , 11th - seeded Angelique Kerber , on Saturday . "
Whatever happens , honestly , " Williams said , " it 's an incredible effort from me . "
The left - handed Kerber , a former No .
1 and two - time major champion , beat 12th - seeded Jelena Ostapenko 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 earlier Thursday . "
Seeing her back , it 's great , " said Kerber , who has lost six of eight previous matches against Williams . "
I know that she is always pushing you to the limits . "
Kerber let 2017 French Open champion Ostapenko determine the outcome of nearly every point .
By the end , Ostapenko had far more winners , 30 - 10 , and far more unforced errors , 36 - 7 .
Williams vs. Kerber will be a rematch of the 2016 final .
Williams won that for a second consecutive Wimbledon title , then sat out the grass - court tournament last year while pregnant , part of a 16-month gap between majors .
After giving birth to daughter Olympia last September , Williams was treated for blood clots . "
I lost count after , like , four surgeries , " said Williams , who has been wearing compression leggings this fortnight as a precaution .
Her first Grand Slam tournament back was the French Open , where she won three matches before withdrawing last month because of an injured chest muscle .
All of the time away pushed someone who 's spent more than 300 weeks ranked No .
1 down the rankings -- she began Wimbledon at 181st , but was seeded 25th on account of her past success -- and no one could quite be sure how the American would fare over these two weeks .
Not even Williams knew . "
This is not inevitable for me .
I had a really tough delivery ... and almost did n't make it , to be honest , " Williams said . "
I remember I could n't even walk to my mail box , so it 's definitely not ' normal ' for me to be in a Wimbledon final . "
The victory over Goerges extended Williams ' winning streak at Wimbledon to 20 matches , dating to the start of the 2015 edition .
She 's also won her past 15 Grand Slam matches since the start of the 2017 Australian Open , which she won while pregnant .
That title pushed her past Steffi Graf 's record of 22 majors in the half - century professional era ; Court won some of her Slams during the amateur era .
Williams ' match against Goerges was even until 2-all , 30-all .
Until then , Goerges , the first seeded player Williams faced these two weeks , showed she was capable of trading power from the baseline and big serves with Williams .
There were moments when watching Goerges made it easy to wonder how it could be possible she never had been past a major 's fourth round until now .
Or , more to the point on this afternoon , how such a stinging serve and groundstrokes did n't help her avoid first - round exits each of the past five years at Wimbledon .
But she could n't keep up with Williams , who grabbed 18 of 22 points and five consecutive games to close the first set and begin the next . "
She brings her ' A game ' in a lot of important moments , " Goerges said . "
We saw that she improved every single match she 's playing here . "
There was one brief blip to come : Williams got broken for the only time while serving for the match at 5 - 3 .
Immediately , though , she broke back at love to end it , placing her left fist on her chest when Goerges ' last shot landed long .
Later , Williams was asked whether this has been her most trying comeback in a career that 's had its share , including an earlier bout with blood clots in her lungs . "
I do n't know if it 's been the toughest , because I have Olympia .
For me , I only see joy out of it , " Williams said with a smile . "
In a way , it 's by far the toughest , but in a way it 's by far the best . " _ _ _

AP LOUISVILLE , Ky. ( AP ) -- A group of former Louisville men 's basketball players have filed a lawsuit against the NCAA over the organization 's vacation of the Cardinals ' 2013 national championship and 2012 Final Four .
John Morgan , one of several attorneys representing former Cardinals captain Luke Hancock , the 2013 Final Four Most Outstanding Player , and four teammates from that title team , said a lawsuit had been filed and described the NCAA as " a morally bankrupt organization " that exploits student - athletes during a Wednesday news conference .
The suit filed Wednesday in Jefferson County Circuit Court does not specify monetary damages .
It states the NCAA cast the plaintiffs in a false light and seeks declaration that it wrongfully vacated the plaintiffs ' wins , honors and awards .
Morgan added , " If all we get is this championship back for Louisville , and the players , and the city , and Luke 's MVP back , that 's going to be plenty pay for us . "
The attorney also mentioned former Louisville players Gorgui Dieng , Tim Henderson , Stephan Van Treese and Mike Marra as plaintiffs in the lawsuit .
The NCAA stripped Louisville of the title as part of sanctions for violations discovered during an escort scandal investigation .
Hancock stressed that his title ring " is not coming off " and said the embarrassing scandal continues to dog him despite not being involved . "
It 's been five years and I ca n't tell you two days where I 've gone without having someone come to me and ask me if I had strippers or prostitutes in the dorm , " he said . "
I 'm excited that Morgan & Morgan has partnered with us and is going to represent us because enough is enough . "
NCAA spokeswoman Stacey Osburn told The Associated Press that the organization has n't received a copy of the lawsuit and declined to comment Wednesday afternoon .
The governing body in February denied the school 's appeal and vacated 123 victories , including their third NCAA title , following an escort 's book allegations in October 2015 that former basketball staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers for sex parties .
Louisville removed the championship banner from its home arena soon afterward . "
We are used to fighting giants , " Morgan said . "
In the sports world , I do n't think there is any Goliath that exists like the NCAA .
The NCAA is a giant , but the NCAA is a morally bankrupt organization that has taken advantage of economically disadvantaged young people throughout our country . "
They answer to nobody but are bad for everybody . "
The liability attorney did not mention former Louisville coach Rick Pitino , who has denied knowledge of the activities alleged by Katina Powell in her book " Breaking Cardinal Rules : Basketball and the Escort Queen . "
Hancock said he frequently talks with Pitino but did not specifically ask if he wanted to be involved .
Several investigations soon followed after Powell 's allegations , including ones by the school and the NCAA .
Louisville 's own investigation found that violations did occur and imposed penalties including sitting out the 2016 postseason in an effort to mitigate NCAA penalties .
The organization in June 2017 ordered Louisville to vacate victories that included the championship and Final Four appearance for activities it described as " repugnant " in its decision .
Pitino was suspended for five games for failing to monitor McGee and vowed to fight the penalties .
The school and the coach vowed then to fight the penalties .
As the appeals process unfolded , the Hall of Fame coach was suspended and eventually fired after 16 seasons last fall following Louisville 's acknowledgment of its involvement in a federal corruption of college basketball .
Pitino is not named in the federal complaint and has denied knowledge of any payments made to the family of former Louisville recruit Brian Bowen .
The coach is suing the school along with sportswear maker Adidas , which dropped him after his firing . _ _ _

AP MANCHESTER , England ( AP ) -- Manchester City has signed Riyad Mahrez for a club - record 60 million pounds ( $ 80 million ) as it further strengthens its team after winning the Premier League title .
The 27-year - old Algeria winger was an integral part of Leicester 's astonishing run to the title in 2016 , but has been pushing to leave the central England club for a year .
Pep Guardiola 's City , which won the league by 19 points in May , confirmed Tuesday evening that Mahrez has signed a five - year contract .
Mahrez will go down as one of the bargains of the Premier League era , having joined Leicester for a reported 400,000 pounds ( now $ 530,000 ) from French club Le Havre in 2014 .
Scoring 17 goals in Leicester 's title - winning campaign saw Mahrez voted as player of the year in England in 2016 . "
I am so pleased to have joined City , a side playing great football under Pep Guardiola .
They 're redefining the English game and I wanted to be a part of it , " Mahrez said on City 's website . "
Watching them from afar has been a pleasure .
Pep is committed to playing attacking football , which is a perfect for me , and City 's performances last season were outstanding ... I believe my own game can develop under Pep 's management . "
City director of football Txiki Begiristain said Mahrez " beats defenders and creates space ... We 're sure he will bring additional attacking quality to our squad . "
Mahrez helped Leicester to a shock league title , and then played a major role in the club reaching the Champions League quarterfinals the following season .
He made 180 appearances for Leicester , scoring 48 goals .
AP MILAN ( AP ) -- Elliott Management has promised to inject 50 million euros ( $ 66 million ) in capital after taking over Italian club AC Milan .
Former owner Li Yonghong missed Friday 's deadline to repay part of a loan worth more than 300 million euros from the U.S.-based hedge fund and Elliott has repossessed the holding company in Luxembourg that Li used to buy seven - time European champion Milan in April 2017 . "
Ownership and control of the holding company that owns AC Milan has today ( Tuesday ) been transferred to funds advised by Elliott Advisors ( UK ) Limited ( " Elliott " ) , " read a statement by Elliott . "
This transfer has occurred as a result of steps taken to enforce Elliott 's security interests after the previous owner of AC Milan defaulted on its debt obligations to Elliott . "
The fund had been expected to sell the club on , with a number of parties reportedly interested in buying the beleaguered Serie A outfit .
Italian - American businessman Rocco Commisso -- who owns North American Soccer League team the New York Cosmos -- said last weekend that he was still keen to buy Milan , while the Ricketts family that owns the Chicago Cubs also said it was negotiating .
However , Elliott appears to be planning for the long term with founder and co - CEO Paul Singer pledging to return the club " to the pantheon of top European football clubs where it rightly belongs . " "
Elliott fully appreciates the challenge and responsibility that ownership of this great institution entails , " the statement said . "
Elliott is pleased not only to support the club during this difficult time , but also by the challenge of achieving ambitious objectives in the future via the on - field success of coach ( Gennaro ) Gattuso and his players . "
As first measures , Elliott intends to inject 50 million euros of equity capital to stabilize the club 's finances , and plans to inject further capital over time to continue to fund AC Milan 's transformation . "
Milan last year spent more than 200 million euros ( then nearly $ 250 million ) on new players amid questions over the financial stability of the Chinese - led consortium that purchased the club from Silvio Berlusconi for $ 800 million .
Milan finished sixth in Serie A to qualify for the Europa League but has been banned for one year by UEFA for overspending and breaching financial fair play regulations .
It is appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .
Elliott 's statement added : " Having assumed control , Elliott 's vision for AC Milan is straightforward : to create financial stability and establish sound management ; to achieve long - term success for AC Milan by focusing on the fundamentals and ensuring that the club is well - capitalized ; and to run a sustainable operating model that respects UEFA Financial Fair Play regulations . "
The Milan board will meet on Thursday to call a shareholders ' meeting .
The new composition of the board should be decided on and approved by the end of next week and could include former Italy and Milan captain Paolo Maldini .
A World Cup of surprises concludes with a final of contrasts .
Powered by the dynamism of Kylian Mbappe , France has youthful exuberance in a side packed with some of soccer 's highest - value talent .
It also has pedigree -- winners in 1998 and finalists in 2006 .
Croatia has a veteran roster that has been stretched to the limit but continues to win in Russia .
The Croats never give in , prevailing in a shootout against Denmark , again on penalties against Russia -- after being stung by a late equalizer -- and then recovering from conceding early against England .
Just do n't suggest Croatia will be weary in Sunday 's final when it returns to the Luzhniki Stadium on Sunday .
Croatia 's star midfielder Luka Modric said " we will see who will be tired " was the team ethos going into Wednesday 's semifinal , feeling Croatia had been under - estimated by the English .
Modric , along with Mario Mandzukic , are the 32-year - olds who have propelled Croatia to its first major soccer final .
In the previous four World Cups : Croatia failed to qualify in 2010 and was ousted in the group stage the other three occasions .
Before then , in its World Cup debut in 1998 , Croatia did reach the semifinals , where it lost to France .
When Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic visited the team hotel in Moscow on Wednesday that 1998 game was on his mind -- even before beating England . "
We might have the chance for the revenge in the finals with the French , " Plenkovic said .
Now they get it .
Croatia advanced to its first World Cup final with a 2 - 1 extra - time win over England on Wednesday night .
France beat Belgium 1 - 0 a night earlier . "
We have a good opportunity to give them something back for 20 years ago when they reached the final , " Croatia defender Dejan Lovren said . "
Maybe it 's our time to revenge something but it 's a tough game and it will be difficult . "
A country of 65 million , France has stars like 19-year - old sensation Mbappe , midfielder Paul Pogba and striker Antoine Griezmann .
Croatia is the fourth - smallest country of the 32 World Cup teams with just over 4 million people .
It has a chance to be the least - populous nation to win since Uruguay took the title in 1950 , when it was a nation of just over 2 million . _ _ _

England defender Kyle Walker is finding meaning in the game no one wants to play .
The third - place match at the World Cup is often dismissed as a pointless way for FIFA to fill TV space with two teams who just want to go home .
But for Walker , a bronze medal still has value . "
It 's still something massively to play for , to be the third - best team in the world , " Walker said after Wednesday 's semifinal loss to Croatia . "
Who would have thought it , at the start of the tournament when everyone was writing us off ? "
We 've still got a very important job come Saturday to go and beat the Belgians and get the bragging rights over them because they beat us in the group stage . "
England and Belgium have both produced last - gasp victories at the World Cup -- Belgium beating Japan 3 - 2 , England beating Colombia on penalties -- but their two games together lack significance .
Both had already qualified for the round of 16 when Belgium beat England 1 - 0 in the last game of the group stage on Adnan Januzaj 's curling shot in a game likened to a friendly thanks to 17 lineup changes .
Much of the talk was about whether finishing first or second in Group G would open up easier games .
In the end , it meant little as both advanced to the semifinals .
Not everyone seems as enthusiastic as Walker .
Harry Kane , the leading scorer at the World Cup with six goals , said he is n't motivated by the chance to secure the Golden Boot for top scorer in the third - place game . "
It 's not something I 'm really thinking about , " he said . "
It 's not the game we wanted to be in , as a team .
It is what it is , but we 'll try and play that game with as much pride as a team as try and finish on a high .
We 're still going to be hurting . "
PREMIER LEAGUE TEAMMATES Even if the result is quickly forgotten by the fans , it will be remembered in Premier League locker rooms .
Five Premier League clubs have players on both sides of the game .
Walker can face Manchester City teammates Vincent Kompany and Kevin de Bruyne , while Tottenham boasts three players for Belgium and five for England .
Liverpool , Manchester United and Chelsea are the other three clubs represented in both squads .
HISTORY A third - place game can still be exciting .
Germany overturned a 2 - 1 deficit to beat Uruguay 3 - 2 in the 2010 game as Diego Forlan sent a free kick off the crossbar in the last minute .
However , many third - place games have been one - sided , like the Netherlands ' 3 - 0 victory over Brazil in 2014 , or a source of trivia , like Turkey 's 3 - 2 win over South Korea in 2002 .
That game is best known for Turkey forward Hakan Sukur scoring the fastest World Cup goal in history , needing only 11 seconds to make it 1 - 0 . _ _ _

Gareth Southgate and England are ready to face the music .
No other soccer nation dwells on decades of failure quite like the English .
Southgate was so demoralized by his penalty kick failure against Germany in the 1996 European Championship semifinals , he avoided The Lightning Seeds " Three Lions , " the team 's official song when it hosted the tournament .
Now the song , with its repeated chorus of " football 's coming home , " is a staple again , No .
5 this week on YouTube UK 's top music videos chart with more than 2 million views on the day of England 's last match . " '
Football 's coming home ' is a song I could n't even listen to for 20 years , frankly , so for me it has a slightly different feel , " Southgate said Tuesday on the eve of England 's World Cup semifinal match against Croatia . "
But it 's nice to hear people enjoying it again . "
When the song first was released , the chorus proclaimed " Three lions on a shirt / Jules Rimet still gleaming / Thirty years of hurt / never stopped me dreaming . "
A 1998 update changed the third verse to " no more years of hurt . "
England has n't played in the semifinals of a major tournament since Southgate 's penalty kick at Wembley was saved by Andreas Koepke 22 years ago , and Andrea Moeller put the next kick over David Seaman and under the crossbar .
The most - cherished national team memory remains the 1966 World Cup final victory at Wembley over West Germany , a demarcation point in the island 's history as much as 1066 ( the Norman invasion ) and 1707 ( union with Scotland ) . "
It was a long time ago , so not too many of us can remember that far back , " said midfielder Jordan Henderson , born in 1990 .
The winner Wednesday advances to Sunday 's final against France .
Southgate wants to break stereotypes , and not just on the field . "
I 'm rare breed .
I 'm an Englishman that does n't drink tea , " he said .
England and Croatia are teams that innovated over time but have generally been immutable during the World Cup , sticking to virtually identical starting lineups except for group phase finales , after advancement was secure .
In the other four games , Croatia 's only variable to its 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation was whether to start captain Luka Modric in a deep midfield role and Andrej Kramaric more advanced , or to move up Modric and start Marcelo Brozovic .
Right back Sime Vrsaljko limped off during the quarterfinal win over host Russia and goalkeeper Danijel Subasic had a hamstring injury during extra time but remained in the match .
When asked about injuries , Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic responded through a translator with inconclusive palaver about Vrsaljko having " this niggle . "
England has gone with a 3 - 5 - 2 , and the only change was to start Ruben Loftus - Cheek in midfield after Dele Alli injured a thigh . "
The biggest thing that the gaffer 's brought since he 's come in , which he 's brought right from day one , was identity , and about the way that we wanted to create a team , " Henderson said . "
You can see that togetherness on the pitch now , and I think that 's valuable in crucial moments in big games , and yeah , I can definitely say this is most together England team that I 've been involved in , and so I think that makes a massive difference and you get your rewards for that . "
With an average age of 26 , England is one of the youngest teams at the World Cup . "
We were never quite sure how far this team could go , " Southgate said . "
The age of the players , the improvement in the players , the hunger in the players has been apparent for everybody to see .
We 're really proud in the style that we 've played , with the intelligence that we 've played , and that we 've performed under pressure and dealt with difficult situations in games where we 've had to wait until the last minute to score , we 've had to recover from conceding in last minute , we 've been through extra time , penalties . "
Croatia made its only semifinal appearance in 1998 , losing 2 - 1 to host France .
Defender Dejan Lovren is a teammate of Henderson 's on Champions League finalist Liverpool , and Lovren bristled when asked about a 4 - 1 loss at Tottenham last October when England striker Harry Kane scored twice . "
It 's completely irrelevant , " he said through a translator . "
Why did n't you ask me how I played well against him ?
You are just nitpicking my poor performances . " _ _ _

Harry Kane will likely come home from the World Cup with the Golden Boot as the tournament 's top scorer and a burnished reputation as a feared forward .
Had Kane added to his six goals in Russia with either of his back - to - back chances in the first half against Croatia on Wednesday , when England was dominating and led 1 - 0 , he could yet be lifting the trophy on Sunday .
Or the header in stoppage time at the end of 90 minutes when the score was 1 - 1 and a goal would likely have brought England back to Moscow for the final against France .
Rising high at the back post to meet another precise free kick from Kieran Trippier , Kane misconnected and the ball bounced wide of the goal . "
It 's been great to get to this stage but we wanted to keep going .
We wanted to win it all , " Kane said . "
It hurts .
I do n't know what else to say .
It just hurts . "
When Kane got his best chances in the 30th minute against Croatia , his first shot was saved by goalkeeper Danijel Subasic .
The ball rebounded almost out of play , then sat up for Kane to take another shot from less than two yards at a tight angle .
The ball hit the post , ricocheted off Subasic and somehow looped up to safety .
Kane would not get another such opportunity with the ball at his feet .
And Croatia would never let England get so close again .
Mario Mandzukic shot past England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the 109th minute and Croatia closed out a 2 - 1 victory to reach its first World Cup final .
It meant another World Cup semifinal heartbreaker for England , only this time the game was under control before it was lost .
In 1990 , three years before Kane was born , England also fell short at the semifinal stage -- on penalties against West Germany .
That team also exceeded expectations and won the adulation of fans at home with a beloved center forward who played for Tottenham .
History in Turin had its echo in Moscow on Wednesday , and England 's scorer 28 years ago , Gary Lineker , was at the Luzhniki Stadium to see it .
At this year 's World Cup , teams can pay a heavy price for not getting a second goal to reward itself for a dominating period of play .
England learned that lesson in its opening 2 - 1 win over Tunisia in Volgograd .
An energetic first 30 minutes reaped only a single goal from Kane .
The North Africans then leveled with a penalty .
The team needed Kane to use his head in stoppage time to get the winner . "
We were really comfortable in the game , " said England defender Harry Maguire , who twice rose highest at corners in the first 15 minutes to send headers wide of Croatia 's goal . "
The only disappointment was that we were 1 - 0 up , and we should have been more . "
Against Croatia , when the late chance came again , Kane could only guide it wide . "
I 'm sure we lacked in some areas , there are things we could 've done better , " Kane said . "
We restored some pride back into the shirt , which was an important thing for us to do . "
England coach Gareth Southgate praised Kane , who is two goals ahead of Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku for the Golden Boot .

In a literal case of life imitating art , Mick Jagger went to see England and England lost .
The Rolling Stones frontman was at the Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday to see Croatia beat England 2 - 1 in extra time in the World Cup semifinals .
Last year , Jagger unexpectedly released a pair of solo songs .
One of the songs was called " England Lost , " and its starts with the tale of someone ostensibly going to watch England play a soccer match and finishes with some political commentary about Britain 's exit from the European Union . "
I went to see England , but England 's lost , " Jagger sings . "
And everyone said we were all ripped off . "
Jagger arrived in Russia for the World Cup after he and his bandmates completed a short European tour in Warsaw on Sunday .
He attended Tuesday 's match between France and Belgium in St. Petersburg and then came to Moscow to see his home national team play -- and lose to -- Croatia .
Jagger has been a regular in recent years at major soccer tournaments .
He attended the World Cup final four years ago in Brazil and also watched the United States play Ghana in the round of 16 at the 2010 tournament in South Africa .
He was at that match alongside former President Bill Clinton , who had a cameo in the Martin Scorsese - directed Rolling Stones concert film " Shine A Light . "
But Jagger , who is also a keen cricket fan , has been thought of as a bit of a jinx at World Cup soccer stadiums .
During another European tour in 2014 , Jagger wrote some encouraging words on Twitter ahead of England 's match against Uruguay in the group stage . "
Let 's go England !
This is the one to win ! ! , "
he wrote .
England lost .
Jagger then predicted at a show in Rome that Italy would beat Uruguay in a subsequent group match .
Italy lost .
At an earlier concert in Lisbon , Jagger said Portugal would win the title in Brazil .
The Portuguese were eliminated in the first round .
Then came the semifinals , which essentially cemented Jagger 's reputation as a harbinger of bad luck in Brazil .
The man who sang " Hoo Doo Blues " on the band 's most recent album went to Belo Horizonte to see the host nation face Germany with his son Lucas , who is half Brazilian .
Brazil lost , big time .
Those examples only reinforced the theory that began in South Africa in 2010 .
A day after the U.S.-Ghana match , Jagger attended England 's game against Germany .
England lost .
He then went to watch Brazil play the Netherlands in the quarterfinals with his son , who was wearing the national team 's yellow jersey .
Yes , Brazil lost .
Perhaps it was that dire history that prompted Jagger to write " England Lost , " which he released last July -- one day after his 74th birthday -- along with " Got ta Get A Grip . "
At the time of release , Jagger said in a statement that the song was about more than just watching his team lose a soccer match . "
It 's obviously got a fair amount of humor because I do n't like anything too on the nose , " Jagger said then , " but it 's also got a sense of vulnerability of where we are as a country . "
Regardless of why he wrote " England Lost , " it certainly did n't help England win on Wednesday . _ _ _

On both ends of the field , Sime Vrsaljko got the job done .
The Croatia defender set up the equalizer in the second half and then saved a likely goal by clearing a shot off the line in the first half of extra time .
Those two moments of excellence helped Croatia reach its first World Cup final following a 2 - 1 win over England on Wednesday , setting up a title match against France .
Vrsaljko , who plays for Atletico Madrid , had struggled to be ready for the match after playing in two previous extra - time matches , but he found the strength to lift his tired , battered team to a comeback win .
With Croatia trailing 1 - 0 , Vrsaljko curled in the cross that Ivan Perisic volleyed into the net in the 68th minute .
In extra time , he leaped high to block John Stones ' header , keeping Croatia in the game before Mario Mandzukic scored the winning goal about 10 minutes later . "
Just a memorable night .
We deserved to be in that final after such an amazing effort , " Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic said . "
For us , it was impressive to watch a team such as the English , that is so strong physically , and they could n't keep up anymore , and we did have that energy . "
The Croats entered the match after winning their previous two games on penalty kicks , but they showed no sign of fatigue in the second half against England .
With three straight extra - time matches , Croatia has played the equivalent a full 90-minute match more than France has through six games in Russia .
France also has an extra day of rest after beating Belgium 1 - 0 on Tuesday .
Besides scoring , Perisic also hit the post for the second straight game and set up Mandzukic 's winner , heading a poor clearance toward the Juventus striker to score .
The victory improves Croatia 's previous best showing at the World Cup , which ended in a 1998 semifinal loss to the host French . "
We have a good opportunity to give them something back for 20 years ago when they reached the final , " Croatia defender Dejan Lovren said . "
Maybe it 's our time to revenge something but it 's a tough game and it will be difficult . " _ _ _

One of the most notorious dives in soccer history took pace the last time France played Croatia in the World Cup .
Les Bleus led Croatia by a goal in their 1998 semifinal at Stade de France when French defender Laurent Blanc gave Slaven Bilic a slight shove on the chest in jostling during a free kick .
Bilic shouted and slammed the palm of his hand into his face , as if he had been struck on the head .
Spanish referee Jose Manuel Garcia bought the act in the pre - video review age , and Blanc was ejected for the first time in his career .
Despite seeing the replay afterward , FIFA refused to retract the penalty .
Blanc missed the final , when France beat Brazil 3 - 0 for its only World Cup title .
Croatia advanced to its first World Cup final with a 2 - 1 extra - time win over England on Wednesday night , a day after Les Bleus beat Belgium 1 - 0 .
The match two decades ago remains on the mind of current Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic . "
Maybe the dear Lord is giving us an opportunity to settle a score , " he said .
A victory in the final for the nation known for its red - and - white checkered jerseys would be the nation 's greatest sporting moment since breaking from Yugoslavia to become an independent state in 1991 -- a year after its national soccer team started playing .
France is a European soccer power , its team able draw from a population of about 65 million . "
They have upped their game over the past several games , " Ivan Perisic said .
Croatia has just over 4 million people , the fourth - smallest of the 32 World Cup teams ahead of Panama , Uruguay and Iceland .
It has a chance to be the least - populous nation to win since Uruguay took the title in 1950 , when it was a nation of just over 2 million . "
We 're a small country with so many successful sports people , " defender Dejan Lovren said through a translator . "
Over the last couple of days people have recognized that . "
Les Blues won the European Championship at home in 1984 and in the Netherlands in 2000 .
But there have been no trophies since current coach Didier Deschamps lifted the World Cup as captain on July 12 , 1998 -- 5 months , 8 days before star striker Kylian Mbappe was born .
They lost the 2016 Euro final 1 - 0 to Portugal at Stade de France with a roster that included nine holdovers on this year 's team . "
Two years ago it was tough , " said one of the returnees , goalkeeper Hugo Lloris . "
We do n't want it to happen again .
We want it to end in the best way . "
Croatia was under French control from 1809 - 14 , part of the Illyrian Provinces , an autonomous area of Napoleon 's First French Empire .
It has played France five times , losing three games and drawing two .
The only other meeting at a tournament was in the group stage of the 2004 European Championship , when a controversial referee 's call went against the Croats .
Goalkeeper Tomislav Butina 's clearance was blocked at the top of the penalty area by the hand of David Trezeguet , who kicked the ball into the net for an equalizer in the 64th minute of a 2 - 2 draw .
Danish referee Kim Milton Nielson allowed the goal to stand .
Nielson had called a questionable foul for a free kick that led to Zinedine Zidane scoring the opening goal in the 48th minute .
Croatia went ahead in the 1998 semifinal only 26 seconds into the second half when Aljosa Asanovic split the defense with a pass , and Davor Suker scored his fifth goal of the tournament .
Lilian Thuram tied the score a minute later after stealing the ball from Zvonimir Boban near the Croat penalty area and exchanging passes with Youri Djorkaeff .
Thuram scored the go - ahead goal with a curling shot in the 70th minute , and France won 2 - 1 .
Now Suker is the much - criticized president of the Croatian Football Federation .
The national team was forced to play a European Championship qualifier against Italy in an empty stadium in Split in June 2015 because Croat fans had thrown flares on the field during a match against the Azzurri at Milan .
A swastika became visible on the field of the closed - doors match , caused by a chemical agent put in the grass at Poljud Stadium .
That led European soccer 's governing body to deduct a point from Croatia , ordered to play two additional games without fans and fined 100,000 euros ( then $ 117,000 ) . _ _ _

9:55 p.m. It seems even some tennis fans at Wimbledon would rather watch England 's World Cup semifinal than closely watch the action at the All England Club .
Wimbledon 's No .
1 Court was less than one - third full for the men 's quarterfinal match between John Isner and Milos Raonic , which was being played at the same time as England took on Croatia in Moscow .
Centre Court was close to full for the more high - profile match between Rafael Nadal and Juan Martin del Potro taking place at the same time .
Only some blotches of empty seats were visible , although plenty of fans had their attention divided between their phone screens and the court .
All England Club chief executive Richard Lewis said this week that tennis fans would be allowed to use their phones to follow the football match , as long as they did n't disturb the players or other supporters .
No .
1 Court had been full for the earlier quarterfinal between eight - time champion Roger Federer and Kevin Anderson of South Africa , who rallied from two sets down to beat the Swiss star .

8:15 p.m. The topic of the World Cup was always going to be raised at the NATO summit with French President Emmanuel Macron and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel both there .
Particularly because many Belgians continued to be convinced their team should be playing Sunday 's final instead of Les Bleus .
During Wednesday 's opening statement at the official summit meeting , Michel veered off track from discussions on military spending to give his opinion on France 's 1 - 0 win over Belgium in the World Cup semifinals .
With all other of the 28 leaders listening , Michel addressed Macron directly and said " Frankly , Emmanuel , yesterday the French team was very lucky . " "
Belgians are generally not too chauvinist , " Michel said , before boasting " Belgium played a great game against France . "
Then he tried to pull the discussion back to military issues . "
Like in football , fair play and team spirit is what we need more than ever , " Michel said in an apparent jab at U.S. President Trump who keeps questioning why the United States must carry such a heavy financial burden in defense of the West .
Trump did n't immediately respond .

FIFA diversity chief Federico Addiechi says soccer 's world body will talk with national broadcasters and its own TV production team .
The subject arose Wednesday in a review of FIFA 's anti - discrimination program in Russia .

Addiechi says FIFA 's stance is " a normal evolution , " and broadcasts in Russia have already improved from the 2014 World Cup in Brazil .

The director of a group called the Fare network that helps FIFA tackle discrimination says 30 cases of " sexism on the streets " by male fans were reported .
Fare director Piara Powar says about half of those involved female broadcasters being " accosted while on air . "
He estimates " there 's many , many more unreported " cases where Russian women were targeted .
Racism had been predicted as a likely problem because of longstanding issues in Russian soccer and among some other European fan bases .
FIFA imposed fines during the tournament on soccer federations including Serbia , Russia and Poland for racist , nationalist and offensive banners spotted at games .
Powar says the World Cup 's international audience is " very different to the fans that come to domestic football . "
He suggests " if you come to this tournament with prejudices , and do n't like people from a different nationality , then generally you 're in the wrong place . " _ _ _
4:45 p.m. The chairman of Russia 's World Cup organizing committee has lamented an apparent lack of fans for the semifinals and final .
There were hundreds of empty seats for France 's 1 - 0 semifinal win over Belgium on Tuesday in St. Petersburg , and the four European countries in the semifinals have n't brought the huge traveling fan groups which South American countries had .
Travel agents have reported a late surge of interest from fans in Britain and Croatia , although getting match tickets and visas could be tricky .
Arkady Dvorkovich says " The teams that had most fans in Russia left early .
Latin American teams , Germany , some other teams left , and we 're left in the semifinals with the teams that have the least number of supporters , so it 's not really good for the economics of football during this last week . "

May says England coach " Gareth Southgate and the boys have done a fantastic job and I 'm sure that they 're going to go on and do well .
I just wish them all the very best of luck . "
The last exchange did n't prove lucky for May , with Belgium beating England in group play .
But Belgium was eliminated by France in the first of the World Cup semifinals , a pathway through the knockout stage that England avoided .

2:45 p.m. FIFA is letting a top Croatian soccer official watch the team 's World Cup semifinal against England from a VIP section on Wednesday despite him being convicted last month in a corruption case linked to the transfer of Luka Modric .
When Croatia beat Russia in the quarterfinals on Saturday , the soccer federation 's CEO - like director general sat in the same row of seats as state President Kolinda Grabar - Kitarovic and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev .
Damir Vrbanovic has retained his position since being sentenced by a court in Croatia in June to a three - year jail term -- though Article 68 of FIFA 's disciplinary code bars officials " convicted of a criminal offense in the past five years . "
However , FIFA has decided that the sentence is not final because the former Dinamo Zagreb director general is appealing to a higher court . _ _ _

Phillies prospect Enyel De Los Santos was slated to be the International League 's starting pitcher in the Triple - A All - Star Game on Wednesday .
Instead , he joined the big club and made the most of an unexpected opportunity .
De Los Santos won his major league debut and Philadelphia got home runs from Maikel Franco and Odubel Herrera in a 7 - 3 victory over the New York Mets on Tuesday night .
Franco drove in four runs as the Phillies won for the 10th time in 13 games and took over sole possession of first place in the NL East .
Nick Williams had three hits and two RBIs , and Rhys Hoskins also got three hits .
De Los Santos allowed three runs and five hits over 6 1/3 effective innings .
The 22-year - old right - hander was called up from Triple - A Lehigh Valley , where he was 9 - 3 with a 1.89 ERA in 16 starts , and matched against another starter making his big league debut in Drew Gagnon of the Mets . "
I was going to start that Triple - A game but this is much better , " De Los Santos said through a translator . "
This is a dream come true . "
Staked to an early lead and armed with an unorthodox and deceptive slingshot delivery that Philadelphia manager Gabe Kapler dubbed a " crossfire , " De Los Santos ( 1 - 0 ) cruised for most of the night against a scuffling Mets lineup that 's managed only eight runs over the last five games . "
It 's kind of a short - arm stroke , " Kapler said . "
Hides the ball with his body well and leads to uncomfortable swings . "
De Los Santos walked three and struck out six .
He threw 94 pitches , 58 for strikes .
His girlfriend and a few winter ball teammates were in the crowd to cheer him on . "
A very , very poised , confident individual on the mound and in the dugout , " Kapler added . "
The job he did was tremendous . "
Acquired from San Diego in December for shortstop Freddy Galvis , De Los Santos was also chosen to play for the World Team in Sunday 's All - Star Futures Game .
It was the first time a Phillies starter made his debut against another starter in his first outing since Sept. 25 , 1944 , according to the Elias Sports Bureau .
Back then , Charlie Ripple faced Charlie Gassaway of the Chicago Cubs at Shibe Park .
Amed Rosario had three hits for the Mets , including two triples to left field .
New York has dropped 19 of its last 23 home games .
Franco put the Phillies ahead with a three - run homer off Gagnon ( 0 - 1 ) in the second . "
The changeup was up .
Anyone could have hit that out , " Gagnon said . "
But hat 's off to him . "
Franco is batting .440 with two homers and seven RBIs over his last eight games .
He added an RBI single in the sixth and made several nifty plays at third base on hard - hit grounders . "
I 'm seeing the ball better , " Franco said .
Williams lined a two - run single in the third .
Herrera clubbed a solo shot into the Phillies ' bullpen in the fifth for his career - high 16th home run .
The 28-year - old Gagnon was charged with six runs and seven hits in 4 2/3 innings .
He also hit two batters with pitches .
At the plate , Gagnon drove in Rosario with a sacrifice fly -- giving his family in attendance something to cheer about . "
Surreal , " Gagnon said . "
Finally here . "
BEEN A WHILE The Phillies are alone in first place after July 1 for the first time since 2011 .
TRAINER 'S ROOM Phillies : Hoskins crashed violently with his face into the padded left - field wall while chasing Rosario 's triple in the third .
Hoskins , who broke his jaw in late May when he fouled a ball off his mouth , remained in the game after being checked by Kapler and a trainer . "
After I hit the wall and I threw the ball in , that was the first thing I thought of , " Hoskins said . "
I was like , ' Oh , my God .
Is my jaw OK ? '
But yeah , I 'm fine . "
Mets : 2B Asdrubal Cabrera exited in the seventh with a hyperextended left elbow but should be able to play Wednesday night , according to manager Mickey Callaway . ...
RHP Noah Syndergaard plans to throw a bullpen Wednesday .
If all goes well , he will start Friday night against Washington .
Syndergaard has been sidelined since late May with a strained ligament in his right index finger . ...
RF Jay Bruce felt discomfort in his hip when he began baseball activity .
He has been shut down for a 10-day period that started Sunday , according to Callaway .
After that , Bruce 's condition will be reassessed .
UP NEXT Phillies : Recovering from a bruised forearm , RHP Vince Velasquez ( 5 - 8 , 4.69 ERA ) is expected to return from the 10-day disabled list to start Wednesday night 's series finale .
Velasquez was hit just below the right elbow by a line drive on June 30 .
He retrieved the ball and threw it left - handed to first base to get the out , falling to the ground in pain immediately afterward .
Mets : All - Star RHP Jacob deGrom ( 5 - 4 , 1.79 ERA ) tied a season high with eight innings of one - run ball against Tampa Bay last Friday .
He leads the majors in ERA . _ _ _

San Diego Padres rookie left - hander Eric Lauer popped out of the dugout for the ninth inning and was greeted by Cake 's " The Distance " on the PA , as well as the heart of the Los Angeles Dodgers ' order . "
When you 're out there you notice everything , especially the song , " Lauer said . "
It made me think about it .
I was kind of like , ' Do n't put that in my head too much .
I still have to get three outs . ' "
Lauer did n't quite go the distance , coming within one out of his first career complete game before allowing Max Muncy 's home run .
Manager Andy Green decided the 115-pitch performance was enough .
Kirby Yates came on and struck out All - Star Matt Kemp to seal the Padres ' 4 - 1 victory Tuesday night .
Green said he wanted Lauer to experience the emotion of going out for the ninth .
After Muncy 's home run , Green said Lauer at least deserved a conversation before the manager decided that the rookie , backed by home runs by Wil Myers and Austin Hedges , had done enough . "
He knows those feelings .
Hopefully those feelings push him the next time he 's out there .
One more out to get the next time .
Ca n't leave that out in front of you .
I thought he was great all the way through , " Green said . "
It was cool to experience that , " Lauer said . "
I have n't experienced it yet .
It was my first time so hopefully I 'll get to experience it more . ...
That 's big for a starting pitcher .
You do n't get there too often .
To know what 's going to happen , how it will feel , it will start to feel like just another inning , hopefully . "
Lauer ( 5 - 5 ) took a three - hit shutout into the ninth inning after having thrown 101 pitches .
He got Enrique Hernandez to fly out to center and Justin Turner to fly out to deep left before Muncy drove a 1 - 1 pitch into the seats in left , his 21st .
Lauer , 23 , said almost getting the complete game ranked just behind the no - hitter he threw at Kent State in 2016 , just a few weeks before the Padres took with him with the 26th pick overall in the amateur draft . "
A little more satisfying , " he said . "
I feel like I had really good command of all my pitches and it 's the first time I really had four , five pitches working .
I do n't think I threw a changeup today , but it was still in the back of my mind that I had it available . "
Lauer struck out a career - high eight and walked two in winning consecutive starts for the first time .
He also had his ninth pickoff of the season , nabbing Muncy in the second after a leadoff walk . "
The fastball velo was up a couple ticks than it normally is , " Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about Lauer . "
He was beating us with the fastball .
I thought there were some well - hit balls tonight . ...
Munce put a good swing late .
But we really did n't threaten all night . "
Lauer improved to 2 - 0 against Los Angeles . "
It 's the Dodgers , man , " he said . "
Nobody likes the Dodgers .
You want to get them a little more than any other team .
I 've been fortunate to do good against them so far .
Hopefully I can keep it rolling against them , " he said .
Myers homered for the sixth time in four games and Hedges had a three - run shot .
Myers , who has played in only 28 games this season due to injuries , has heated up after a second stint on the disabled list .
He hit three home runs Saturday in a 20 - 5 loss at Arizona , hit another in the 16th inning on Sunday to give the Padres a 4 - 3 win over the Diamondbacks , and then homered in the ninth inning of an 8 - 2 loss to Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers on Monday night .
His homer Tuesday night , to left - center on a 2 - 1 pitch off Rich Hill , ( 2 - 4 ) , was his eighth overall .
Hedges hit his fourth of the season earlier in the inning , off the Western Metal Supply Co. brick warehouse in the left field corner at Petco Park on a 1 - 2 pitch .
Jose Pirela drew a leadoff walk and Freddy Galvis singled ahead of Hedges ' homer .
Eric Hosmer just missed homering in the third , when center fielder Cody Bellinger leaped to make the catch at the fence .
Hill allowed four runs and eight hits in seven innings , struck out seven and walked one . "
I 'm tired of losing .
I hate losing , " Hill said . "
When you have good stuff and , unfortunately things just do n't go your way , I mean , obviously that 's the game , but it just ( stinks ) to lose .
Something that really eats at me . "
The teams finished the game in a quick 2 hours , 18 minutes .
Padres center fielder Manuel Margot made a nice diving catch of Justin Turner 's fly ball in the seventh and then made a sliding catch of Chris Taylor 's sinking liner to end the eighth .
UP NEXT Dodgers : RHP Kenta Maeda ( 5 - 5 , 3.24 ) , the scheduled starter for the third game in the four - game series , is 4 - 3 with a 4.70 ERA in 10 career starts against San Diego .
Padres : Rookie LHP Joey Lucchesi ( 4 - 4 , 3.27 ) is 1 - 1 with a 1.26 ERA in his last three starts . _ _ _

The NFL Players Association filed a grievance with the league on Tuesday challenging its national anthem policy .
The union says that the new policy , which the league imposed without consultation with the NFLPA , is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement and infringes on players ' rights .
The filing met a statute of limitations deadline and will be heard by an independent arbitrator , an NFLPA spokesman said .
In May , the NFL approved its national anthem policy at its owners meetings in Atlanta .
The policy allows players to protest during the national anthem by staying in the locker room , but forbids them from sitting or taking a knee if they 're on the field or the sidelines .
Teams will be subject to fines if players do n't comply and will have the option of punishing players .
When the league announced the policy , Commissioner Roger Goodell called it a compromise aimed at putting the focus back on football after a tumultuous year in which television ratings dipped nearly 10 percent ; some blamed the protests for such a drop .
The union said at that time that it would file a grievance against any change in the collective bargaining agreement .
The union said Tuesday it has proposed having its executive committee talking to the NFL instead of proceeding with litigation .
The union said the NFL has agreed to those discussions .
The NFL declined to comment about the union 's action .
In 2016 , then-49ers quarterback , Colin Kaepernick began protesting police brutality and social injustice by kneeling during the national anthem , and the demonstration spread to other players and teams .
It became one of the most controversial and sensitive issues in the NFL , with players saying their messages last year were being misconstrued , while others -- including President Donald Trump -- called them unpatriotic .
Trump even said NFL owners should fire any player who refused to stand during the anthem .
Following those comments , more than 200 players protested during the anthem that weekend before the number of protesters dwindled as the season progressed . "
We 're here for a bigger platform , " Raiders tight end Jared Cook said during the spring . "
We 're not just athletes .
We 're people that live this .
It 's people in our neighborhood , it 's people that we grew up with , it 's people that we know who are actually living through these circumstances .
So when we speak on it , it 's not like we 're just speaking out of the side of our neck .
It 's things that actually touch home and things that we can actually relate to . "
All I have to say is , I just think it 's sad that it 's veered from something that stood for good and the whole narrative has changed into something that 's negative when that was not what it was initially about in the first place . "
The NFL started requiring players to be on the field for the anthem in 2009 -- the year it signed a marketing deal with the military . "
We want people to be respectful of the national anthem .
We want people to stand , " Goodell said at the May meetings , when he dismissed concerns about the lack of union involvement by contending the league met with countless players over the past year . "
We 've been very sensitive on making sure that we give players choices , " the commissioner added , " but we do believe that moment is an important moment and one that we are going to focus on . "
The league and the Players Coalition have been working in tandem on efforts to support player initiatives in the community and for a variety of social issues .
The NFL is committing $ 90 million over the next seven years to social justice causes in a three - segment plan that involves league players . _ _ _

AP PHOENIX ( AP ) -- Authorities say former UCLA basketball player Billy Knight has died in Phoenix .
The Maricopa County Medical Examiner 's Office has n't released a cause of death .
Phoenix police say Knight 's body was found on a roadway early Sunday near downtown and there was no evidence of foul play .
The 39-year - old Knight was a guard / forward at UCLA from 1998 - 2002 , averaging 14.1 points and 3.5 rebounds per game as a senior .
He was n't picked in the 2002 NBA draft and played professionally in France and Japan .
Knight was a basketball operations assistant for the Northern Arizona Suns of the developmental G League in the 2016 - 17 season .
The team is affiliated with the NBA 's Phoenix Suns .
Northern Arizona Suns officials issued a statement Tuesday evening saying they were " deeply saddened by the passing . "
AP PITTSBURGH ( AP ) -- In his first two starts after coming off the disabled list in late June , Washington Nationals starter Jeremy Hellickson allowed 12 runs over 8 2/3 innings .
He reversed that trend in a big way Tuesday night , tossing five innings of two - hit ball in a 5 - 1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates .
Hellickson ( 3 - 1 ) struck out three and induced seven ground balls as he was both effective and efficient , finishing his outing at 67 pitches . "
I would 've liked to go a little deeper , but we just needed a win , " Hellickson said . "
So , it 's just good to feel good again .
These last five days have been pretty rough . "
After losing eight of nine , Washington has won four of its last six .
The Nationals could afford to pull Hellickson early thanks to the big lead provided by Anthony Rendon , Daniel Murphy and company . ?
In the fifth inning , Rendon hit at two - run homer , his 13th of the season .
Murphy contributed a hit to a three - run sixth as part of a 4-for-4 night that included two doubles .
It was a big night for Murphy , who has n't been able to get his bat going since returning in June from offseason knee surgery .
The four - hit outing raised his batting average to a season - high .250 . "
It 's no secret that I have n't really been super productive so far in my at - bats , but I 'm feeling better and hopefully I can grind them out myself and do something to help the ballclub win each night , " Murphy said .
Pirates reliever Steven Brault walked in a pair of runs in the sixth and Adam Eaton added on with an RBI single .
Rendon 's homer was the only damage against Pirates starter Joe Musgrove ( 3 - 4 ) , who struck out a career - high nine over five innings .
It was Musgrove 's first outing back from a trip to the disabled list for a finger infection .
An elevated pitch count , including 27 in the first inning , led to his early exit . "
With the pitch count up , I was getting tired after two innings and working a lot harder than I would have liked to , " Musgrove said .
The Pirates loaded the bases in the ninth , but newly installed closer Kelvin Herrera struck out Francisco Cervelli to end it .
Herrera will handle the ninth inning in place of Sean Doolittle , who was placed on the disabled list with left toe inflammation .
The start of the game was delayed 50 minutes due to rain in the area , but it never rained at PNC Park .
TOUGH NIGHT Bryce Harper went 0 for 5 with four strikeouts and his batting average fell to .215 .
Harper and Musgrove grew up playing against one another and Musgrove called it a " friendly matchup . " "
I 'm just going to look at it as a bad game , " Washington manager Dave Martinez said of Harper . "
He 's a professional and he 'll be right back out there tomorrow . "
ROSTER MOVES The Pirates optioned right - handed pitcher Alex McRae to Triple - A Indianapolis to make room for Musgrove .
McRae did not appear in a game with Pittsburgh .
Washington replaced Doolittle with reliever Wander Suero , who was recalled from Triple - A Syracuse along with starter Austin Voth .
Voth will pitch Saturday .
Jefry Rodriguez was optioned to the minors .
TRAINER 'S ROOM Nationals : RHP Stephen Strasburg ( right shoulder inflammation ) made his first rehab start with Class A Potomac .
He pitched 3 1/3 innings and allowed two hits , one run and one walk while striking out five .
Pirates : C Francisco Cervelli ( concussion ) was given the day off .
He made back - to - back starts after coming off the disabled list Sunday .
UP NEXT Nationals : LHP Gio Gonzalez ( 6 - 5 , 3.76 ERA ) is scheduled to start Wednesday 's series finale .
He is 0 - 3 over his last six starts but is 4 - 1 in his career against Pittsburgh .
Pirates : RHP Trevor Williams ( 6 - 7 , 4.60 ERA ) is coming off his shortest outing of the season , when he allowed five runs over 2 1/3 innings against Philadelphia on July 6 . _ _ _

AP Police acknowledged Tuesday that a woman was assaulted during a home invasion at a suburban Atlanta house owned by NFL star LeSean McCoy , hours after graphic posts on social media accused the Buffalo Bills running back of bloodying his former girlfriend .
One female was treated and released from the hospital , while another sustained a minor injury during a targeted invasion early Tuesday , Milton police said in a release responding to requests by The Associated Press .
McCoy denied allegations posted on social media earlier in the day accusing him of hurting his former girlfriend . "
For the record , the totally baseless and offensive claims made against me today on social media are completely false , " McCoy said in a statement released on two of his social media accounts . "
Further more , I have not had any direct contact with any of the people involved in months . "
McCoy was responding to an Instagram post from a person who said she is friends with the injured woman .
The post showed a graphic photo of the former girlfriend and accused McCoy of physically abusing her , his son and his dog , as well as injecting steroids .
The woman who posted the accusations and the ex - girlfriend have not responded to messages left by The Associated Press , though both Instagram accounts showed pictures of the women together in London during a music festival , with comments on each other 's posts .
The AP generally does not identify people who may have been victims of abuse .
Police said it 's not clear how many suspects were involved , but one demanded specific items from one of the women in the home .
Police spokesman Charles Barstow said he could not release any further details .
The Bills issued a statement saying they have been in contact with McCoy and the NFL and will continue gathering information .
NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said the league is reviewing the matter .
McCoy turns 30 on Thursday and is preparing to enter his fourth season with the Bills .
He spent his first six seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles , where he led the NFL in yards rushing in 2013 before being traded to Buffalo in 2015 .
He has never been suspended by the NFL for using performance enhancing substances during his nine - year career .
Fulton County Magistrate Court records show that McCoy initiated eviction proceedings against the former girlfriend in July 2017 , saying that the pair were no longer in a relationship .
Court records show two attempts to serve the former girlfriend with the document but no other action .
Eviction paperwork was filed again last month with McCoy listed as the plaintiff and the woman and " and all others " listed as the defendant .
The sworn statement to initiate the proceedings was signed by Tamarcus Porter , who played football with McCoy in college .
Porter was arrested with McCoy following a nightclub brawl involving off - duty police officers in Philadelphia in February 2016 .
No charges were filed after prosecutors said they could not prove who initiated the fight in which two officers were injured .
The sworn statement signed by Porter said McCoy is the owner of the house and that his ex - girlfriend was refusing to leave .
No attorney for McCoy is listed in court records for the June 6 filing .
The former girlfriend challenged the eviction June 22 , saying she had been in a relationship with McCoy for at least two years and that she and her children have lived with McCoy at his house since October 2016 , according to a motion filed by her lawyer .
A hearing on the woman 's motion had been scheduled for Tuesday afternoon , but her attorney requested a delay because of a family emergency .
The judge issued an order resetting the case 30 days .
McCoy discussed marriage with her over Memorial Day and , on May 29 , gave her " a substantial gift , " the motion says .
McCoy left Georgia the next day and had not returned , the motion says .
The woman went to Virginia on May 31 to attend her sister 's graduation .
While she was gone , on June 1 , McCoy had some of his friends , family members and others remove her furniture and furnishings without her knowledge , the motion says .
The woman saw this happening through security cameras that she could monitor on her cellphone and called the police , the motion says .
The police stopped the removal .
The eviction papers were served on the woman 's 16-year - old son on June 11 .
The woman 's lawyer argues that serving the eviction papers on a minor was improper and invalid and the proceedings should be quashed .
The lawyer also argues that since Porter is not an attorney , the case should be dismissed .
The woman 's attorney claims the eviction action was " completely falsified " by Porter , that McCoy never asked her or her children to leave the home .
The last time the pair spoke was on June 1 , when McCoy said he was going to meet the woman in Virginia for her sister 's graduation . _ _ _

AP POMONA , Calif. ( AP ) -- Prosecutors say former NFL cornerback Brandon Browner has been charged with trying to kill his ex - girlfriend after breaking into her Southern California home .
Browner , who won Super Bowls with the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots , was arrested Sunday east of Los Angeles .
The LA County District Attorney 's Office says the 33-year - old was charged Tuesday with attempted murder , first - degree residential robbery and other counts .
It was n't immediately clear if he has a lawyer .
Arraignment is scheduled for July 30 .
Prosecutors say Browner broke into the apartment , chased and dragged the woman and then tried to smother her in a carpet .
Prosecutors say he also stole a Rolex watch valued at about $ 20,000 .
Browner is from nearby Pomona and played for Oregon State University before signing with the Seahawks in 2011 .
AP PONTE VEDRA BEACH , Fla. ( AP ) -- The PGA Tour has eliminated a FedEx Cup playoff event as part of a revamped , tighter schedule that will allow its season to end a week before the football season begins in the United States .
Most of the changes to the 2018 - 19 schedule released Tuesday already had been announced .
The final piece was where to put two new tournaments between the U.S. Open and British Open .
Detroit - based Quicken Loans is calling its event the Rocket Mortgage Classic on June 27 - 30 .
It will be followed by the 3 M Open in Minnesota and the John Deere Classic .
The tour will feature 46 events over 41 weeks , down from 48 tournaments this year .
The addition of new tournaments in Detroit and Minnesota is offset by eliminating the FedEx Cup playoff event in Boston , the Quicken Loans National that had been run by the Tiger Woods Foundation in the Washington , D.C. area , and a year off for the Houston Open and Greenbrier .
Houston and Greenbrier are to return to the fall portion of the schedule in 2019 .
The TPC Boston , meanwhile , will rotate with a New York - area course every other year for the opening FedEx Cup playoff event .
Behind the tighter schedule was a desire for the tour to complete its season at the Tour Championship before the start of college football and the NFL .
Key to the changes was the PGA Championship moving from August to May , and The Players Championship returning to March .
The wraparound season starts Oct. 4 - 7 with the Safeway Open in Napa , California , one week after the Ryder Cup in France .
The Mexico Championship will move to the end of the West Coast Swing , giving Florida four straight tournaments in March .
The PGA Championship will be May 16 - 19 at Bethpage Black on Long Island , splitting part of the Texas swing -- the AT&T Byron Nelson in Dallas will be the week before the PGA , and the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial will be the week after the PGA .
The RBC Canadian Open moves a week before the U.S. Open , held next year at Pebble Beach .
The tour really gets busy at the British Open , set for next year at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland .
Top players then go straight to Tennessee for the FedEx Cup Invitational , a World Golf Championship in Memphis that replaces the event held at Firestone in Ohio .
The three playoff events are The Northern Trust at Liberty National in New Jersey ; the BMW Championship at Medinah outside Chicago ; and the Tour Championship , which will be Aug. 22 - 25 at East Lake in Atlanta .
Two tournaments on the schedule no longer have title sponsors listed with their names -- the Mayakoba Classic ( previously OHL ) in Mexico and Reno - Tahoe in Nevada , which previously had been called the Barracuda Championship .
Still to be determined is whether the PGA Tour will change the structure for the FedEx Cup , and how this new schedule will work in 2020 when the Olympics are in Japan from July 24 to Aug. 9 .
The Ryder Cup in 2020 will be Sept. 25 - 27 at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin .
The 46 events include four tournaments held opposite World Golf Championships , and one event opposite the British Open .
That leaves 11 weeks when the PGA Tour does not have an official event .
AP QUIMPER , France ( AP ) -- It 's time for the Tour de France climbers to stretch their legs on what Brittany proudly refers to as its cherished , if miniature , version of an Alp .
After several days when the sprinters shined , the race gets its first summit finish on Thursday at the relatively short , but steep , Mur de Bretagne to end Stage 6 .
Riders will make two trips up the category-3 " wall " at the end of the 181-kilometer ( 112-mile ) leg starting in the western port city of Brest .
Devoid of the spectacular heights of southern France , the cycling - crazed Bretons say the Mur de Bretagne is their version of the famous Alpe d'Huez , the mountain in the Alps etched into the race 's lore that riders will venture up on Stage 12 .
That comparison leaves their lovely Mur quite diminished , however .
While the Mur tops out at an altitude of 293 meters , Alpe d'Huez rises to 1,850 meters .
Here 's a gastronomic , sporting and cultural glance at Thursday 's route : BAGUETTE AND BUTTER : Race favorite Chris Froome is 57 seconds off the lead , so he could try to gain back some time ahead of the treacherous cobblestoned Stage 9 .
In 2011 , Cadel Evans won a stage ending atop the Mur en route to his Tour title .
PLAT DU JOUR : Do n't miss Brest 's specialty , " morue a la Brestoise , " a baked cod dish of minced fish , potatoes , onions and leeks .
Or try a filling mashed potato galette -- a pancake with potato mixed into the dough that can be stuffed with salmon , sausage or bacon .
CULTURE : Sailing boats from around the world flock every four years to participate in Les Tonnerres de Brest ( Brest Festival of the Sea ) .
The next chance to observe skippers and crew parade their craft around the city 's harbor will be in 2020 .
VIN DU JOUR : Too tempestuous for winemaking , Brest has turned to brewing craft beers .
Brasserie du Baril brewery offers a " Baril Originale " inspired by American beers , and a " Baril White , " which resembles a German wheat beer .
HISTORY : A major naval base since the 17th Century and the home to France 's Naval Academy , Brest was severely damaged when Allied forces retook the port from German occupation during World War II .
When the Germans surrendered , Gen. Hermann - Bernhard Ramcke asked American commander Charles Canham to see his credentials .
Canham , who had a lower rank than Ramcke , pointed to his troops and said , " These are my credentials . "
QUOTE OF THE DAY : " We always see a bit of action there . " --
Froome on the Mur de Bretagne .
STAT OF THE DAY : 89 -- Earning the green points jersey for an 89th time on Wednesday , Peter Sagan surpassed Erik Zabel 's Tour record .
DIGESTIF : Help put that hearty dinner to bed with a nip of Lambig , also known as Fine Bretagne , which is distilled from Breton apple cider .
Besides being a popular digestif , it can be used as a flambe finish for crepes .
NEXT ORDER : A 231-kilometer ( 143.5-mile ) flat ride on Stage 7 from Fougeres to Chartres is the longest leg of the race . _ _ _

AP QUIMPER , France ( AP ) -- Peter Sagan had the yellow jersey holder to thank for his victory on Stage 5 of the Tour de France on Wednesday .
Chris Froome could also thank his Team Sky colleagues for keeping him out of danger -- and helping overcome a mechanical problem -- in the race 's first hilly stage .
Greg Van Avermaet mistimed his sprint and Sagan , the three - time reigning world champion with the Bora - Hansgrohe team , took advantage to claim his second victory in this year 's event . "
I do n't know if he did it on purpose or if he wanted to drop everybody but I have to say thanks , " Sagan said .
Van Avermaet still increased his overall lead over BMC teammate Tejay van Garderen to two seconds by gaining precious time in an intermediate bonus sprint .
After a move from Philippe Gilbert , Van Avermaet accelerated out of the final turn with 300 meters ( yards ) to go but could n't maintain his pace . "
I tried to win the stage but it was pretty complicated , " Van Avermaet said . "
Phil went early and he 's still pretty close on GC ( general classification ) so I could n't let him go .
I think I went too early in the sprint .
I thought the corner was closer to the finish than it really was . "
In a repeat of Stage 2 , Sagan held off Sonny Colbrelli in the sprint , with Gilbert finishing third .
Sagan clocked nearly five hours over the undulating leg through Brittany , which contained five categorized climbs over a 204.5-kilometer ( 127-mile ) route from Lorient to Quimper , and resembled a single - day classic .
Gilbert , a former world champion , moved up to third overall , three seconds off the pace .
Froome , the four - time champion who trails Van Avermaet by 57 seconds in 15th spot , finished in the main pack with the other favorites .
There was a nervy moment for the British rider when he had to stop due to a mechanical issue with 70 kilometers remaining .
Teammate Michal Kwiatkowski attempted to fix the problem but Froome was later forced to stop again and change his bike .
Kwiatkowski and two other teammates then quickly escorted Froome back to the peloton .
Froome and Sky were also at the front in the finale , ceding the lead to the stage hunters only in the final kilometer . "
Everyone knew that was going to be a tricky finish today , a very undulating day -- never really flat -- just up and down , " Froome said . "
A nice day to have behind us . "
It 's the kind of stage where something can be wrong and you quickly find yourself losing 30 - 40 seconds if you get caught out of position .
It was a day to stay up front and really stay on it . "
Seven riders broke away eight kilometers into the stage .
The group established a lead of about four minutes as they wound along the Atlantic coast through picturesque towns like Riec - sur - Belon -- which is famous for its oysters -- and Pont - Aven -- which inspired artists like Paul Gauguin .
While Brittany is usually rainy and windy , this time it was sunny and racing conditions were perfect .
Fans waving the black - and - white striped flag of the region swarmed the climbs .
Sylvain Chavanel , the 39-year - old riding in a record 18th Tour , launched a solo attack from the breakaway with 100 kilometers remaining but did n't get far .
French rider Elie Gesbert , another member of the breakaway , crashed on a short descent , ending up in a ditch and appearing to scrape his face along a stone wall .
But he got back on his bike and continued .
Lilian Calmejane and Tom Skujins , the last remaining members of the breakaway , were caught by the main pack with 10 kilometers to go .
The Tour remains in Brittany for Stage 6 on Thursday , another hilly leg of 181 kilometers ( 112 miles ) from Brest to Mur - De - Bretagne Guerledan , including two climbs of the short but steep Mur - de - Bretagne . "
We always see a bit of action there , " Froome said . "
I sometimes prefer those stages to the fast , flat stages . " _ _ _
This story has been corrected to show it was the 5th stage , not the 4th . _ _ _

AP SAN FRANCISCO ( AP ) -- Jose Quintana told Kyle Hendricks he would do all he could to follow him with another strong start by the Cubs rotation .
This is exactly what manager Joe Maddon hoped to see : the pitching getting on a little roll and hitters doing their part as the second half nears .
Victor Caratini hit an RBI double during a decisive seventh inning , helping Chicago back Quintana in a close game and beat the San Francisco Giants 2 - 0 on Tuesday night .
A night after losing 2 - 1 in 11 innings despite a strong start from Kyle Hendricks , the Cubs had enough offense for Quintana ( 8 - 6 ) -- and they could have a healthy third baseman Kris Bryant back in the lineup for Wednesday afternoon 's series finale .
Quintana allowed three hits in six scoreless innings to beat the Giants for the first time in his career after the lefty went 0 - 3 with a 5.82 ERA over his first three starts . "
I said to Kyle ' I 'll try to follow you , ' " Quintana said . "
It 's really good for us . "
Addison Russell 's one - out double in the seventh chased Giants starter Derek Holland ( 5 - 8 ) .
Russell advanced on Sam Dyson 's wild pitch and scored on a bad throw by catcher Nick Hundley trying to get Russell at third .
Caratini later doubled .
Carl Edwards Jr. struck out the side in order in the seventh , Justin Wilson followed with a perfect eighth and Steve Cishek closed it out for his third save after taking the loss Monday .
Maddon said afterward Brandon Morrow was n't available for the ninth because of a planned second consecutive day off .
The Giants got just one baserunner over the final four innings . "
We 've had a lot of good innings out of a lot of different members of our bullpen , " Maddon said . "
So when it got to that tonight it 's not like it was anything new . "
Holland struck out eight and did n't walk a batter in 6 1/3 innings .
Johnny Cueto had been the announced scheduled starter , but manager Bruce Bochy gave Cueto an extra day to recover , something that could be the norm in the second half for the veteran right - hander .
Holland has been versatile : In less than a week , he pinch - ran , pitched twice in relief then returned to the rotation . "
If I have to go back to the ' pen I 'll be perfectly fine , " he said . "
Whatever Bochy and the guys come up with , I 'm going to do . "
Giants center fielder Gorkys Hernandez returned to the lineup after missing Monday 's game nursing a tight calf that forced him to an early exit Sunday against the Cardinals .
Aside from a pinch - hit appearance in the eighth , Buster Posey had the night off for the Giants and was scheduled to catch the day game Wednesday .
He has to skip the All - Star Game because of a lingering right hip injury that will require an injection .
FAMILIAR MAN ON THE PA Former Giants third base coach Tim Flannery will handle public address announcer duties for Wednesday 's series finale as Renel Brooks - Moon participates in San Francisco Mayor - Elect London Breed 's inauguration . "
A great honor for both of us , " Flannery posted on Twitter .
TRAINER 'S ROOM Cubs : Bryant was headed to the Bay Area hoping he will be ready to come off the disabled list and play Wednesday afternoon 's series finale against the San Francisco Giants .
Bryant , out since June 23 with inflammation in his left shoulder , played rehab games for Double - A Tennessee on Monday and Tuesday .
He had hoped to re - join the Cubs during their series at AT&T Park .

AP ST .
PETERSBURG , Russia ( AP ) -- France President Emmanuel Macron is attending the World Cup semifinal between France and Belgium at St. Petersburg Stadium .
Macron met with King Philippe of Belgium , who was with his wife Queen Mathilde , as they took their seats Tuesday shortly before kickoff .
Macron and King Philippe shook hands warmly and Macron patted the Belgian royal on the chest .
Macron is an avid soccer fan and supports southern French club Marseille .
AP ST .
PETERSBURG , Russia ( AP ) -- It 's good the French make lots of Champagne , because with the trophy - winning potential of its team that will play in the World Cup final on Sunday , they could be bathing in the stuff for years to come .
Like Spain 's team that won everything -- two European Championships and one World Cup -- in an awesome spell of dominance from 2008 to 2012 , the youthful , skillful Bleus could have the makings of a dynasty .
Why ?
Let 's count the ways .
Heaps of talent , not just on the pitch but on the bench and back in France , too .
A defense that defanged the World Cup 's most prolific scoring team , Belgium , in a semifinal so engrossing that 90 minutes seemed to zip past in half that time .
Youth , so much youth , running through key positions in the team like an electric current .
The average age of France 's starting line - up in the 1 - 0 victory over Belgium was a shade under 26 .
Good for many years to come .
And -- really he should go at the top of this list -- Kylian Mbappe , a.k.a football dynamite and surely the strongest candidate for the World Cup 's best player award .
Imagine how much better , how much more polished France 's young diamond will be at age 21 , at the 2020 European Championship , or at age 23 , at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar , and on and on .
The mind boggles at the potential of the 19-year - old who may be the best deal Paris Saint - Germain ever make , bought one year ago for 180 million euros ( $ 210 million ) and perhaps worth now double that after four fantastic weeks in Russia .
France 's timing is good , too .
Coach Didier Deschamps is getting his pieces to fit just as other football powers in Europe are unraveling .
Portugal , the reigning European champion , will soon have to find a way to win without Cristiano Ronaldo , who although still remarkably potent at age 33 , ca n't carry his country forever .
Germany is in disarray , searching for scapegoats and answers , after the 2014 World Cup champion exited lamely from the group stage this time .
And Spain has flogged its tiki - taka game of possession and passing to death and needs to find a new path to victory and without midfielder Andres Iniesta , who retired after Spain 's loss to Russia in the first knockout round .
Spain 's new coach Luis Enrique has his work cut out .
In short , there 's a vacuum to fill and France is poised to do it .
Unless the English get there first .
Like Deschamps , England coach Gareth Southgate has built his team around young players .
If England beats Croatia in the second semifinal on Wednesday , then the final could see the two youngest teams in the knockout round fighting not just for this trophy but for the momentum that could then help them win more .
For months , Deschamps has been downplaying expectations by making out that France 's youth was a drawback , not its strength .
True , the France team that won the World Cup in 1998 with Deschamps as its captain was considerably older .
But the strength of this team is that its young players already have wise heads that belie their tender years .
Just 25 , Raphael Varane is a rock in the French defense , with a young man 's speed but the big - game maturity from having won multiple trophies with Real Madrid .
With his partner at the back , Samuel Umtiti , still just 24 , France has a central defensive pairing that should frustrate attackers long into the future .
Umtiti 's winner against Belgium was only his third goal for France .
But its quality -- he out - jumped the taller Marouane Fellaini to head in a corner -- suggested there could be more where that came from .
Paul Pogba , at 25 , is curbing his natural exuberance , his playground - football instincts and putting in more sober , stable performance in the midfield .
On the flanks , left - back Lucas Hernandez and right - back Benjamin Pavard , both aged 22 , continue to impress .
Pavard struggled at times against the speed of Belgium 's Eden Hazard and played with more restraint than in previous games , missing several opportunities to get the ball to Mbappe when he was making runs .
But Pavard and Hernandez have shown they are very quick studies .
The victory against Belgium was , for each of them , only the 11th time they have played for France .
Remarkable that their 12th game will be a World Cup final .
Digging up these two treasures was one of Deschamps ' smartest moves .
The big questions for France ahead of Sunday revolve around its central strike partnership of Antoine Griezmann and Olivier Giroud .
Both squandered chances against Belgium .
Griezmann , at 27 , still has a future with France .
But Giroud , at 31 , is increasingly looking like the odd man out , the ponderous weak link when France is surging forward at speed , unable to keep up with Mbappe 's inventiveness and his Usain Bolt - like runs .
After Russia , one answer may be to move Mbappe to the center of the France attack and put Giroud out to pasture .
But how and where to best use Mbappe is a good problem to have .
First things first : Win Sunday , turn all this youthful promise into a trophy , so others can follow . _ _ _

AP ST .
PETERSBURG , Russia ( AP ) -- They 're young , they 're brash and they 're collectively worth a billion dollars .
The one thing missing for this French squad is an international title .
Kylian Mbappe , Paul Pogba and France are about to get that chance .
Les Bleus are headed to the World Cup final .
Samuel Umtiti clinched a 1 - 0 win over Belgium -- and earned the approval of watching French President Emmanuel Macron in the VIP seats at St. Petersburg Stadium -- by scoring on a header off a corner kick in the 51st minute on Tuesday . "
Vive la France !
Vive la Republique ! "
France forward Antoine Griezmann shouted during postgame celebrations .
Umtiti played his part in a strong defensive effort by the French , too , helping to shut out the highest - scoring team at the tournament and leaving Belgium 's golden generation of Eden Hazard , Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku to regret another missed opportunity at a major tournament . "
It 's me that scored , " Umtiti said , " but we all delivered a big game . "
France 's players danced on the field after the final whistle and their fans sang in the stands long past the end of the match , surrounded by yellow - clad security .
They certainly hope to keep the party going on Sunday in the final in Moscow .
France -- with an average age of 26 -- will face either Croatia or England , who play Wednesday at the Luzhniki Stadium in the Russian capital , and has a shot at redemption after losing its last two major finals -- at the 2006 World Cup when Zinedine Zidane was sent off for a nasty head - butt and the 2016 European Championship on home soil . "
We 're immensely privileged to be in the World Cup final , " France coach Didier Deschamps said . "
It was so painful two years ago we have to savor it . "
Deschamps now has the chance to become the third person to win the World Cup as a player and a coach , after German great Franz Beckenbauer and Brazil 's Mario Zagallo .
As France captain , Deschamps raised soccer 's most prized trophy in 1998 .
Deschamps has faced some criticism for being too pragmatic and functional despite having a squad of superstars , but his team was set up superbly against an opponent that was largely restricted to only minor chances and denied on two occasions in particular by France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris .
He dived to his right midway through the first half to claw away Toby Alderweireld 's shot , then got in front of Lukaku to punch away one of the many crosses sent in by Belgium in the final stages .
In a tournament dominated by goals from set pieces , France 's goal came off a corner when Griezmann curled in the ball from the right and Umtiti got in front of tall Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini to knock in his header at the near post .
Up in the corporate seats , president Macron reacted to the goal by shaking the hand of King Philippe of Belgium as FIFA president Gianni Infantino watched on between them . "
Unfortunately for us , the difference is just a dead - ball situation , a set play , " Belgium coach Roberto Martinez said . "
The game was , as you can imagine , very close , very tight , and it was going to be decided ( on ) maybe the one that could find that final touch in the box . "
After reaching the quarterfinals at both the 2014 World Cup and the European Championship in 2016 , Belgium again missed the chance to get to an international final and has yet to fulfil its lofty expectations .
Leading the scoring in this tournament with 14 goals , many thought this could be their year .
With Lionel Messi , Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar no longer in Russia , Hazard and Mbappe have taken over as the stars of the World Cup and there was a buzz every time either got the ball .
Yet while Hazard -- Belgium 's captain -- faded after a strong opening 30 minutes , Mbappe was a constant threat .
His first touch was after 10 seconds and , after receiving the ball on the right wing , he sped past Jan Vertonghen and then Mousa Dembele on a thrilling run .
At 19 , Mbappe was n't even born when France won the World Cup for the first and only time with a squad that is just as diverse as the one Deschamps is leading 20 years later .
Umtiti was born in Cameroon .
Mbappe has Algerian - Cameroonian roots . "
It 's a pure pleasure to see these players grow , " Deschamps said , " and never give up . "
Instead of a trip to Moscow , Belgium will return to St. Petersburg on Saturday for the third - place match no team wants to play . _ _ _
IN THE STANDS Along with the French and Gabonese presidents and the king and queen of Belgium , there was rock ' n ' roll royalty watching the game .
Mick Jagger was one of the many famous faces in the stands at St. Petersburg Stadium .
The Rolling Stones frontman is a big soccer fan , having attended the World Cup final in Brazil in 2014 as well as many England games .
Former Baywatch actress Pamela Anderson , who is the partner of France defender Adil Rami , also was present . _ _ _

AP TAMPA , Fla. ( AP ) -- The Tampa Bay Lightning have signed forward Nikita Kucherov to an eight - year contract extension worth an average of $ 9.5 million in salary and annual bonuses .
The team announced the deal Tuesday .
The 25-year - old would have been a restricted free agent next summer with one year left on a deal that will pay him nearly $ 4.8 million for the 2018 - 19 season .
Now he is set to stay with the Lightning through the 2026 - 27 as the teams highest - paid player once the extension kicks in after next year . "
I m truly grateful to sign this contract extension to keep me in Tampa for another eight seasons , " Kucherov said in a statement . "
I d like to thank the Lightning organization and all of the fans for the support since making the Bay Area my home . "
The two - time All - Star had 39 goals and 100 points with a plus-15 rating last season .
He was third in the NHL in points , sixth in assists and tied for ninth in goals .
He averaged 19:49 in ice time to lead all forwards for the Lightning , who lost in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals to Washington .
The deal also means the Lightning have locked up a core group of players younger than 30 years old .
Tampa Bay now has Kucherov , captain Steven Stamkos , defenseman Victor Hedman , left wing Alex Killorn , left wing Ondrej Palat , center J.T. Miller , center Tyler Johnson and defenseman Ryan McDonagh all signed through at least the 2021 - 22 season . "
My thought is we get the opportunity to open negotiations after July 1 of their last year of their contract , lets sit down with the players and their agents , and see if we can get something done early , " Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman said Tuesday in a conference call with reporters . "
From a players perspective , I think it eases their minds and they can plan their future a little bit and settle in .
And from the teams perspective , it helps us going forward knowing the cap number of the players , knowing the commitment that we have , to make other decisions accordingly . "
AP TAMPA , Fla. ( AP ) -- The Tampa Bay Rays on Tuesday unveiled an elaborate plan for a new domed stadium that would take them across Tampa Bay to the Ybor City section of Tampa at a cost of nearly $ 900 million .
The 30,842-seat stadium would be the smallest in Major League Baseball and would be covered by a fully enclosed and translucent roof , not a retractable dome .
Stuart Sternberg , principal owner of the Rays since 2005 , called the plan " a dramatic break from the past " and explained the blueprint as the franchise 's latest attempt to make a long - term commitment to the region . "
That has the best opportunity to happen here in Tampa , at the center of the Tampa Bay region , " Sternberg said . "
We believe that baseball can not only survive but thrive here in Tampa , and Tampa Bay , and all the growth that comes ahead of us . "
The Rays have consistently ranked near the bottom in attendance at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg , about 20 miles away from the proposed new site .
The Ybor City site is bordered by Channelside Drive on the west , 15th Street on the east , 4th Avenue on the north and Adamo Drive on the south .
No plans were revealed about stadium financing .
The Rays , now in their 21st season in the American League , made the presentation partly to solicit corporate support . "
The test is when people see this , " explained Matt Silverman , the club 's president . "
If people are getting behind this vision for how our ballpark can look and see how it can feed into Ybor City , if we 're on the same page there , we have a better shot at figuring out the plans . "
Melanie Lenz , the Rays ' chief development officer , calculated the " total project cost " as $ 892,429,823 , 30 percent of which applies to the roof .
Sternberg has said he expects to play at Tropicana Field for at least four or five more years , and a best - case scenario for the opening of the new ballpark would be 2023 . "
I think you 're looking at a four - to - five - year buildup , 36 months on the construction side , " Tampa mayor Bob Buckhorn said . "
Will we live or die based on whether we have this stadium ?
No .
We 're going to be fine with or without it , but I would love to have it . " _ _ _

Apples MacBook Pros have always been the most powerful and -- to be sure -- most expensive laptops in the companys lineup .
And with a refresh announced Thursday that gives its laptop lineup more features , do n't look for these top - end devices to get any cheaper .
Still , there 's good news for those of you who engage in video editing or other more vigorous computing activities .
Apple has upgraded two models , the 3-pound 13-inch MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar and the 4-pound 15-inch model with the Touch Bar .
They start at $ 1799 and $ 2399 , respectively .
The company claims the 8th generation , Intel " 6-core " processor on the 15-inch model boosts speeds by as much as 70 percent , while the " quad - core " on the 13-inch version is up to two times as fast .
The 15-inch model can also handle up to 32 GB of memory , and up to 4 TB of solid - state storage and has superior graphics capabilities .
The 13-inch model goes up to 16 GB of memory and 2 TB of SSD storage .
Both computers feature Retina displays with True Tone technology that is supposed to properly match colors to ambient lighting conditions .
And both have what Apple says is a " quieter typing " keyboard .
I have nt yet banged away on one to see just how quiet that is , but frankly the bigger question around the keyboards surrounds their ultimate durability .
Apple has faced widespread complaints and even a proposed class action lawsuit over allegedly defective keyboards on past MacBook Pro ( and MacBook ) models .
The computers also contain Apple designed T2 chips that had been introduced on the iMac Pro desktop .
Apple says the chip bolsters security and on - the - fly encrypted storage , as well as letting you summon Siri on the Mac , without you having to press keys on the computer .
In other words , as you can do on an iPhone , simply call out " Hey Siri . "
Apple is claiming up to around 10 hours of battery life on the new systems .
Each has four Thunderbolt 3 ( USB - C ) ports .
The latest changes are reserved for models with the Touch Bar , the multi - touch glass strip of shortcut keys above the Qwerty keyboard that dynamically change depending on the app you re using .
You can still buy less expensive 13-inch MacBook Pros without the Touch Bar , starting at $ 1299 .
Apple did indicate that the new MacBook Pros are part of a broader Back to School promotion that begins today that includes a pair of qualifying Beats headphones with the purchase of any eligible Mac or iPad Pro for college .
All the new machines , and for that matter , most existing Macs in circulation , will run MacOS Mojave when the updated operating system launches in the fall .

Archaeologists find what may be oldest written record of ' The Odyssey ' You probably had to read Homer 's " The Odyssey " for school , and now archaeologists have found what may be one of the first editions .
Nathan Rousseau Smith has the story .
Arizona Cardinals General Manager Steve Keim identified himself to a Chandler police officer as the team 's director of security when he was arrested July 4 on suspicion of DUI , according to a police report .
The report obtained said Keim 's eyes were bloodshot , his speech slurred and his breath smelled of alcohol when an officer pulled him over early July 4 just several properties down from Keim 's home .
Keim told another officer that he had been " bouncing around " that night and recently left a friend 's house .
He claimed to have had two beers while eating pizza about an hour or two before being stopped , according to the report .
MORE : Cardinals President Bidwill vouches for SCOTUS pick , drawing backlash After he was placed in handcuffs and brought to Chandler police headquarters , he said he had been drinking beer since 4 p.m. and had about two IPAs in the hour before driving home .
The officer who stopped Keim said in his narrative that he first noticed Keim 's black 2018 Ford F-150 about three miles before the traffic stop .
Other takeaways from Keim 's arrest report : He declined to perform several steps in a sobriety test due to a knee injury .
He would not submit to a breath test , so officers took two vials of his blood , which will be tested for blood - alcohol content .
He was previously convicted of DUI in 1996 .
He was cited and released from police custody without being booked into jail . "
Arizona is a place , especially the metro Phoenix area , where anybody can get a DUI , " said Russ Richelsoph , a Tempe - based attorney who has been defending DUI cases for 19 years . "
You can be a police officer , you can be a mayor .
You can be a doctor or a lawyer .
It really does n't seem to matter if you 're famous or well connected , they 're going to treat you the same . "
Richelsoph said Keim 's previous DUI conviction wo n't have any bearing on the current case because it 's more than seven years old .
What will matter is that Keim described himself as a " three " on a scale of one to 10 -- with one being completely sober and 10 being completely intoxicated -- according to the police report . "
Admitting he 's a three , a prosecutor will use that as evidence that he is admitting impairment , " Richelsoph said . "
The problem is , when you answer that way -- the way that Arizona DUI law reads -- if you 're impaired to the slightest degree by alcohol or another substance , that 's DUI . "
Arizona law says a person is driving under the influence if they are at all impaired or have a BAC of 0.08 percent .
Extreme DUI requires a BAC of 0.15 percent or above .
Super - extreme DUI means a person has a BAC of 0.20 percent or above .
Penalties vary .
Keim 's blood - alcohol level will be determined in a lab and could take three months to process .

Artist Pooja Pittie on her lighthouse , " Boundless " In this web exclusive Pooja Pittie , a painter with muscular dystrophy , discusses the artwork she contributed to the public exhibition " Lighthouses on the Mag Mile " in Chicago , and explains to correspondent Dean Reynolds how it reflects her life .
As a young high school graduate , Joseph Schettler had dreams of working for the FBI or becoming a forensic psychologist .
He took steps to make those dreams a reality .
Schettler became the first person in his family to go to college , enrolling in the criminal justice program at ITT Tech in 2006 with assurances from the school that he would surely get a job in his field .
Two years later , Schettler graduated with an associates degree .
But he quickly realized that the time and money he d spent studying did nt get him any closer to a job .
When Schettler tried to transfer to a nearby public college , it accepted very few of his credits . "
I had to start all over , " Schettler , now 30 , said reflecting on that time . "
I felt like I just wasted $ 60,000 . "
Several years later , ITT collapsed in bankruptcy under the weight of accusations from state attorneys general and federal regulators that the school misled students and investors .
Now two of its top executives appear to be walking away from at least some of the allegations relatively scot - free .
ITTs chief executive , Kevin Modany , agreed to pay $ 200,000 to settle a suit with the Securities and Exchange Commission over claims the school misled investors about the impact of two failing student loan programs to the companys bottom line .
The companys chief financial officer , Daniel Fitzpatrick , will pay $ 100,000 .
The executives settlement with the SEC follows a deal ITT reached with the agency .
Attorneys for Modany and Fitzpatrick did nt immediately respond to messages seeking comment .
In the last three full years of ITTs existence , Modany earned more than $ 1 million annually in total compensation , according to a lawsuit filed by the companys bankruptcy trustee .
Shortly after ITT filed for bankruptcy , Modany asserted a claim , seeking more than $ 5 million in deferred compensation as part of the process . (
In a lawsuit filed earlier this year , the trustee overseeing ITTs bankruptcy asked the judge to throw out that request . )
John Grisham : ' Day of reckoning ' coming for student debt Meanwhile , Schettler wakes up before 7 a.m. six days a week at his Michigan home and heads to his job that has nothing to do with his original dream of working in criminal justice .
He also does military service .
In total , Schettler said he earns less than $ 80,000 per year .
He said his time at ITT and the intervening years have taken their toll . "
I have no drive or no ambition to go to school , " he said . "
I sell cars now for a living . "
The contrast in fates between former ITT students like Schettler and the companys top executives is " incredibly grotesque , " said Toby Merrill , the director of Harvard Law Schools Project on Predatory Lending .
At the same time that the students are coping with debt that s not dischargeable in bankruptcy that they ca nt get rid of by filing for bankruptcy and being told to take their degrees off their resumes when job - hunting , " the shell of the company is dischargeable in bankruptcy and the debt is gone , " she said .
And the executives are " being told that they can just walk away , " added Merrill , who is representing former ITT students as part of the bankruptcy process .
Thousands of students are clamoring for debt relief Schettler is one of thousands of former ITT students hoping to get some relief from his debt through the process .
Earlier this year , the trustee overseeing ITTs bankruptcy urged the judge in the case to accept a $ 1.5 billion settlement with a class of former students .
Once the deal gets final approval , the students would be in line with other creditors to get access to any money left over when ITTs bankruptcy case is wrapped up .
It would also cancel nearly $ 600 million in money ITT claimed students owed the school .
But the agreement does nt address the bulk of students debt , which is held by the federal government because many students took out federal student loans .
Even with the deal , " The students wo nt be closer to an outcome that could reasonably be described as fair in a bankruptcy setting until that debt is gone , " Merrill said .
Former ITT students may face challenges getting relief from their debt through other avenues .
The Department of Education is in the midst of re - writing a rule that provides federal student loan borrowers with relief when they ve been misled by their schools .
The rule , known as borrower defense to repayment , has been on the books since the 1990s , but was rarely used until 2015 when thousands of borrowers began clamoring for relief amid the collapse of major for - profit college chains .
After pressure from activists , the Obama administration wrote regulations to create a process for borrowers seeking relief and a system for officials to evaluate their claims .
Now the Department , under DeVos , is looking to change that system , including by offering only partial relief to some borrowers who say they ve been misled .
Schettler , who is married with two kids , knows its unlikely his debt will be completely wiped out , but he s hoping for some relief . "
I m here busting my rear to provide for my family and that debt right there does nt help , " he said .
As for ITT and its officials , he feels like " they re getting off " without enough of a punishment . "
They wanted to make money , they wanted to get rich and they did nt care how people suffered , " he said .
As it pushed to hit its electric vehicle production targets for the quarter , Tesla decided to skip " brake - and - roll " testing for its Model 3 sedans in its Fremont factory .
The news was first reported by Business Insider .
The company managed to meet a self - imposed deadline to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars in a week after several quarters of missing its goals .
But Tesla 's stock plunged by more than 7 percent on Tuesday .
Like other auto makers , the company is facing tariffs that will take effect on Friday .
And , yesterday CFRA downgraded the stock from hold to sell , saying the company 's " burst " production rate for its Model 3s wo n't be sustainable .
Tesla characterizes the brake - and - roll tests it recently suspended as redundant .
The company told CNBC : " Every car we build goes through rigorous quality checks and must meet exacting specifications , including brake tests .
To be extremely clear , we drive * every * Model 3 on our test track to verify braking , torque , squeal and rattle .
There are no exceptions . "
It has not yet said whether or when the tests may be reinstated .
According to Tesla , workers at its Fremont , California factory also conduct alignment checks on the GA3 ( or General Assembly 3 ) line using a system that was designed in - house .
All vehicles have their brakes and alignment tested on - site after they 're fully assembled and before they leave the Fremont factory to go to a service or delivery center , the company confirmed .
Tesla has also changed other processes to speed up production .
For instance , the New York Times reported , Tesla reduced the number of spot welds use in the Model 3 's underbelly by 300 , or about 6 percent .
As President Donald Trump threatens China with another $ 200 billion in tariffs , some U.S. industries are still assessing the damage from China 's retaliatory levies from the first round .
That round amounted to $ 34 billion in tariffs in a tit - for - tat trade war between the two nations .
China targeted a range of commodities that went heavy on agricultural and seafood products , along with U.S.-made cars .
But where did the tariffs hit hardest around the country ?
Just as certain states took bigger hits , so did some counties .
Generally , those counties likely to see the biggest percentage of their workforce impacted by the tariffs are those with small populations and a high level of dependency on a single industry , from chicken parts to construction machinery manufacturing .
Here is a Brookings Institution analysis of the top 15 counties listed by share of local jobs in impacted industries in 2017 that could face harder times because of the tariffs : Aleutians East Borough , Alaska Number of jobs affected : 1,891 Share of local employment : 78.4 % Seafood product prep and packaging Sargent County , North Dakota Number of jobs affected : 1,837 Share of local employment : 63.1 % Construction machinery mfg .

China sells more to the U.S. than the U.S. sells to China .
That narrows China 's options in finding U.S.-made products on which to levy tariffs .
As such , U.S. agricultural products became a big target . "

As self - driving vehicle experiments are launched in a few cities around the U.S. , Mercedes - Benz maker Daimler and a prominent auto supplier are launching a new one in the place that would seem most receptive : Silicon Valley .
Daimler and auto components maker Bosch will start a self - driving vehicle shuttle service in one of the cities south of San Francisco that comprises the heart of the nation 's tech industry beginning in the second half of 2019 .
The move marks a concrete step forward for a partnership announced in April 2017 with the ultimate goal of delivering a self - driving car by 2021 .
Daimler and Bosch will begin their service as a pilot project offering rides for free on " selected routes " to a limited number of customers , said Uwe Keller , head of autonomous driving for Daimler .
The partners also did not reveal the exact location of the pilot , saying they are still in negotiations with city officials . "
The most urgent and difficult work is to develop a system which will work reliably , safely , daytime and nighttime under all circumstances and conditions , " said Michael Fausten , head of urban autonomous driving for Bosch . "
The service would join several other real - world autonomous vehicle pilot projects open to the public in the U.S. Companies conducting tests in cities so far include : * Waymo .
Google 's former self - driving car project is offering self - driving car rides in the Phoenix area and is set to expand its offering to Atlanta . *
General Motors .
The nation 's largest automaker plans to offer a similar service in undisclosed cities in 2019 . *
Uber .
The ride - hailing service has some autonomous cars in Pittsburgh offering rides to passengers , though the company recently ended its Arizona program after a woman was killed when the vehicle and safety driver failed to notice her crossing the street at night .
More : Daimler 's Mercedes , Bosch to deliver self - driving car by 2021 More : BMW , Intel add Delphi to self - driving car alliance More : New York Auto Show : Google 's Waymo buying 20,000 electric SUVs for driverless rides More : GM : Driverless cars mean big savings for ride - hailing service users In addition to these major projects , there are multiple other limited - scope autonomous vehicle shuttles in various locations throughout the U.S. Keller said it 's too early to say how many vehicles will be involved in the Daimler - Bosch project .
Engineers are testing autonomous technologies on Mercedes S - Class luxury sedans and other vehicles , but it 's unclear which will be featured in the pilot project .
Daimler and Bosch already have engineers working together in Silicon Valley and around Stuttgart , Germany , where they are collaborating on self - driving vehicle technologies .
The pilot will be offered through an entity called Daimler Mobility Services .
Daimler and Bosch picked high - tech data processing company Nvidia as a key supplier for the project .
A rival alliance featuring BMW , Intel and Delphi has also set its sights on making a self - driving car by 2021 .
Most other automakers have self - driving cars in the works , as well .
Automakers are racing to be among the first that can field reliable , safe self - driving cars .
No automakers or tech companies are ready for total autonomy , in which a car can handle any circumstance in any location at any time on its own .
Several , namely Waymo and GM , have debuted or announced vehicles that can handle most situations in environments that are digitally mapped in advance to help prevent incidents .

As student debt grows , so do the plans to squelch it .
Some of the ideas are pretty creative : New Jersey , for example , is considering establishing a lottery for borrowers burdened by student debt .
Other ways of garnering money to eliminate your education debt do n't rely on luck , but require rolling up your sleeves or knowing historical facts .
A new game show called " Paid Off , " hosted by comedian Michael Torpey , pits student borrowers against each other in a trivia competition .
One lucky winner will walk away debt - free .
Keep in mind , however , that these endeavors are n't free aid .
The funds are taxable , even money from an organization in return for volunteer work . "
All money you receive for volunteering or win on a trivia app or lottery is considered income by the IRS , " said Mark Kantrowitz , a student loan expert .
Here are some of the other ways to get other people to pay off your debt .
1 ) At your job Currently , just 4 percent of employers offer student debt assistance .
But that 's changing as more employers come to realize education debt is a problem for many of their workers , said Katie Berliner , account executive at YouDecide , a benefits firm . "
In order to attract and retain talent , employers are looking at offering contributions to people 's student loans , " Berliner said .
Companies that have offered their employees help with their student loans include Aetna , Penguin Random House , Nvidia and Staples .
Fidelity announced in May that 25 employers -- including Hewlett Packard Enterprise , New York Air Brake and Millennium Trust -- plan to implement its student debt employer contribution program , with 9,000 employees expected to enroll by the end of June . (
Fidelity also offers a student debt benefit for its own employees . ) "
Do a quick Google search and find the employers who are out there doing this , " Berliner said .
Most likely the company you 're interviewing with wo n't offer the benefit , but that should n't stop you from asking about it , Berliner said . "
In the course of the interview , there comes a point where the interviewer says , ' Do you have any questions ? ' "
Berliner said . "
It would not be out of line to say : ' I want to get your perspective on whether you think this a valuable benefit . ' "

If my going through all this contributes to the world moving a little step forward , then that s a personal crown that will always accompany me , " Ponce told The Associated Press at the offices of the Miss Universe franchise in central Madrid .
The Spanish capital has just wrapped up its 2018 week - long pride celebrations , whose main theme was a call for equality and greater visibility for people with non - binary gender identity .
Rights campaigners marching last Saturday welcomed the World Health Organizations recent move to take trans identities off the official list of mental health disorders , but highlighted discrimination faced by transgender people of all ages , including employment discrimination .
A study published last year by the European transgender group TGEU found that 77.5 percent of 885 transgender people over 16 years - old polled in Georgia , Poland , Serbia , Spain and Sweden had considered taking their own lives and that 24.5 percent of respondents had made at least one attempt .
Ponce said she had suffered discrimination before as a model , being rejected for fashion events or shoots once designers or organizers discovered she had undergone a sex reassignment procedure .
But in those moments , she said her life motto - " To be the best is not an option , is a must " - gave her strength .
She said her experience growing up in a " loving and supporting family " but without any role models in a small town in southern Spain , near Sevilla , can be a useful story for others . "
My parents never had to go to school to demand any changes in attitudes , I did it myself , " Ponce said , highlighting how she would meet aside with every new teacher and tell them : " Whatever name appears in the roll call , you should call me Angela . "
The 5-foot-11 models career took off after she won a provincial beauty award in 2015 , reaching new heights last month with the Miss Universe pageant . "
I closed my eyes , " she said recalling the victory . "
All I wanted was to feel how they put on the crown because I was aware that it was a historical moment . "
In 2012 , 23-year - old Jenna Talackova was banned from Canadas Miss Universe pageant for not being a " naturally born " female .
The organization - run at the time by now U.S. President Donald Trump - changed the regulations after she threatened legal action .
Talackova made it to the shortlist in Canada , but did nt win entry to the international contest .
Six years later , Ponce says that transphobia remains a global problem , even in Spain , a country she sees as a pioneer in the protection of LGBT rights .
After Ponces victory in the Spanish beauty title , she received hundreds of messages of support on social media , but also some criticism - even from some feminist , gay or transgender users who decried beauty pageants in general as objectification . "
We ca nt be hypocritical , " said Ponce , rejecting the charges and describing her victories as success for all transgender people . "
Beauty is used to sell everything around us , and beauty can also help us spread a message of equality . "
Associated Press WASHINGTON - The U.S. military says a service member died Thursday of a wound sustained in combat in eastern Afghanistan .
The name of the service member was being withheld pending notification of family members .
It was the second U.S. military death in Afghanistan in less than one week .
On Saturday , Army Cpl .
Joseph Maciel , of South Gate , California , was killed by what the U.S. is investigating as a possible attack by a member of the Afghan military .
In Thursdays incident , the U.S. military said an Afghan security force member also was killed and several were wounded .
No other details were provided .
At a critical time in the Olympic movement , the U.S. Olympic Committee named Sarah Hirshland , chief commercial officer of the United States Golf Association , as its CEO on Thursday .
Hirshland replaces acting CEO Susanne Lyons and becomes the 12th CEO of the USOC , which has faced criticism from athletes for its role in handling sexual abuse scandals that have engulfed USA Gymnastics , USA Swimming , USA Taekwondo and U.S. Speedskating . "
The USOC is at a critical time in its history and requires an energetic , creative and inspiring leader who will ensure that the athletes we serve are protected , supported and empowered in every possible way , " said USOC chairman Larry Probst . "
We believe we have found that leader in Sarah Hirshland . "
We think we have selected the very best candidate for this very important position . "
Hirshland takes over the organization not only as it seeks to address a sexual abuse crisis in the U.S. Olympic movement , but as it looks to hosting future Olympics .
Los Angeles has secured the Games in 2028 , and the USOC is expected to put forward a Winter Olympics bid in the coming years . "
To be invited to lead the Olympic and Paralympic community in the United States , to be associated with Team USA and to have the privilege to serve Americas athletes is an absolute dream come true for me , " said Hirshland , who will start as CEO by the end of August . "
I recognize the challenges ahead .
We have a critical moment in time in the USOCs history that must be navigated .
We must protect , support and empower all athletes . "
Hirshland comes to the USOC after nearly seven years at the United States Golf Association , most recently as its chief commercial officer .
Before that , she worked for Wasserman Media Group , which is now known as Wasserman .
CEO Casey Wasserman is the chairman of LA 2028 .
More : USA Gymnastics a ' total failure , ' according to investigation of Karolyi ranch More : USA Gymnastics names Tom Forster high - performance director Lyons said the International Olympic Committee is close to approving a joint marketing venture between the USOC and LA 2028 .
The host city would control marketing in the United States starting in 2020 .
Probst said Wasserman was aware of Hirshlands candidacy and was supportive of her getting the job . "
We know one another well .
He certainly knows a lot about my professional working relationships , so well be great partners , " Hirshland said . "
He s a friend .
He s an incredibly talented individual , and he will build and lead a wonderful team .
I have all the confidence in the world about what they ll be able to do , and I know he has confidence in me in this role .
I feel very good about our ability to be a successful partnership . "
Lyons had served in the interim since Scott Blackmun , citing health concerns , stepped down in February shortly after the Pyeongchang Olympics .
He did not attend those Games as he was being treated for prostate cancer .
Earlier that month , Probst had defended Blackmun as the USOC faced increasing criticism for its role in handling sexual abuse complaints and calls for Blackmun to resign . "
Scott has served the USOC with distinction since 2010 , " Probst said at a news conference to open the Olympics on Feb. 9 . "
We believe he did the right thing at the right time . "
In January , the USOC hired Boston - based law firm Ropes & Gray to investigate how it and USA Gymnastics handled complaints they received about Larry Nassar , a longtime doctor for the national governing body .
Nassar was a physician at Michigan State for decades .
More than 300 women and girls have come forward to allege they were abused by Nassar , including Olympic champions Simone Biles , Aly Raisman , Gabby Douglas , Jordyn Wieber and McKayla Maroney .
Nassar , 54 , is serving a 60-year federal sentence for child pornography charges .
He was convicted of 10 counts of sexual assault in Michigan and faces a minimum of 40 years in prison after his federal sentence is over .
Prosecutors in Texas last month filed six counts of sexual assault of a child , a second - degree felony .
Then - USA Gymnastics CEO Steve Penny notified Blackmun of the NGBs concerns about the doctor in the summer of 2015 and that it would be reporting him to law enforcement , Blackmun said in testimony he submitted to Congress last month .
Probst said Ropes & Gray is close to finishing interviews but that he does not expect the investigation to be complete for a couple months .
The USOC previously committed to making the report public .
During her nearly five months as acting CEO , Lyons worked to start changes at the USOC , including examining governance and developing a plan to improve athlete safety . "
We have a large culture shift that needs to happen really across the whole movement that ensures when young people speak up , they should be taken seriously , " Lyons said .
The USOC was not able to include Nassars victims in the search process as it was prevented from contacting them directly because of pending litigation , Lyons said .
How USA Gymnastics , the USOC and the broader U.S. Olympic movement have addressed reports of sexual abuse has been the subject of three Congressional hearings since Blackmun resigned . "
I am deeply sorry for those who were harmed and horrified that this happened on my watch , " Blackmun wrote to the Senate Commerce Committee in June . "
The suffering and brave testimony of the victims and their families will be a painful memory for the rest of my days .
Like millions of others , I applaud the courage of the athletes who have come forward .
I believe the USOC is responsible for leading the efforts of our ( NGBs ) to protect their athletes from abuse , efforts which failed in this case .
I am profoundly sorry for this failure . "
In May , Lyons testified before a House subcommittee that the organization is examining its relationships with the NGBs and what it requires of those organizations .
The governing bodies for each sport effectively operate as independent non - profits but must meet requirements set by the USOC .
In recent years , those requirements have expanded to include minimum safe sport standards .
In 2017 , the USOC required that NGBs change their bylaws to allow them to use the U.S. Center for SafeSport to handle reports of sexual misconduct .
Blackmuns tenure at the USOC came as it looked for a way to bring the Olympics back to the United States for the first time since 2002 .
Bids from New York ( 2012 ) and Chicago ( 2016 ) both failed before Blackmun was hired .
He and Probst worked to repair relationships with the IOC and finalized a revenue - sharing deal that had been a source of contention between the USOC and the IOC .
Los Angeles entered a bid for 2024 and a year ago accepted the 2028 Games as part of an agreement with the IOC and Paris to award two hosts at the same time .
The USOC is also looking at a Winter Olympics bid , most likely from Salt Lake City , in 2030 .
Probst , who is an IOC member , said he would lead the effort to introduce Hirshland to leaders in the Olympic movement over the coming months .

Authorities arrested a woman late Tuesday night believed to be involved the brutal assault of a 91-year - old grandfather in a Los Angeles - area community .
Laquisha Jones , 30 , of Los Angeles , was booked for assault with a deadly weapon , as the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department relayed to KTLA - TV .
Rodolfo Rodriguez had left for a walk near his family 's home in Willowbrook on July 4 when he passed a small girl and a woman , the latter of whom attacked him with a concrete block without warning , he told CNN .
A neighbor , Misbel Borjas , captured the aftermath on video , which shows blood streaming down the grandfather 's face .
He was left unable to walk and suffered a broken cheek bone , bruised ribs and head injuries , KTLA - TV reported . "
She was yelling at him , ' Go back to your country , or ' Go back to Mexico , " Borjas told the Los Angeles Times . "
It was racist . "
Rodriguez is a lawful , permanent resident , according to The Times .
He 's from Michoacan , Mexico .
A motive for the attack remains unknown , the newspaper reported .
Police gained a search warrant for the suspect and still do n't know whether others took part in the attack , per the Times .

Avery Dennison AVY , -1.15 % is the latest example of a persistent trend : the death of the pension plan .
The labeling and packaging company said on Wednesday it was terminating its pension plan , effective Sept. 28 , eight years after first freezing the program .
It also said there would be no change in benefits for the 11,200 current participants , although the plan is currently underfunded by about $ 240 million .
How the ad industry is working to move away from the ' Mad Men ' era See : Government money should help solve this pension crisis What does that mean for plan participants right now ?
The elimination of the plan means current participants will have to choose between receiving their benefit now as a lump - sum payment or as a continuing monthly payment , said Edward Snyder , a financial adviser at Oaktree Financial Advisors in Carmel , Ind. " Its a good time to revisit your financial plan to see how the different pension options will impact your plans and retirement income . "
Of course , that is nt exactly easy .
There are a few stipulations to consider before making a decision , said A.J. Walker , a financial adviser at financial advisory firm Lake Jericho in Chicago .
Participants will have to determine if receiving a lump sum today would be equal to the annuitized payments , or if they may be undersold by doing so .
In some similar scenarios , clients have risked losing out on a substantial amount of benefits because they opted for a lump sum , sacrificing the benefits they were meant to receive .
Do nt miss : This retired sanitation worker makes $ 285 K a year from pension If the math works out , and a lump sum and annuitized payments are equal , participants must then consider who would be managing those assets .
While Avery Dennison manages the pension plan , it is federally insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , but that changes when those assets are transferred to the private insurance companies to manage . "
I would weigh heavily who the provider of the annuity is , " he said . "
You want a good , solid reputable company to have that . "
If not , a lump sum may be the best option as it can be reinvested into diversified stocks and bonds .
The risk of staying with a potentially insecure company is that those assets are exposed to less reliable investments .
This would be an expensive mistake for anyone , but especially for those employees with three or four decades until retirement .
Companies are eliminating pensions , known as defined - benefit plans , opting instead for defined contributions plans , such as the 401(k ) , where participation is voluntary and employees are responsible for their own retirement savings .
Only 16 % of Fortune 500 companies offered a defined - benefit plan to new hires in 2017 , down from 59 % among the same employers in 1998 , according to London - based insurance company Willis Towers Watson .
About half of these companies still employ workers who are actively accruing pension benefits , and 93 % of these companies with a defined - benefit plan in 1998 still manage their plans and assets .
Also , like Avery Dennison , some of these plans have been frozen .
Freezing benefit plans varies based on the terms of the plans , but basically come down to the benefits no long accruing .
Participants will already get the benefits that have grown , but may not earn more moving forward . "
Participants generally need to be on the watch that more of this is coming , " Walker said .
Also see : Heres a way to get a pension - like benefit in retirement Avery Dennison is transferring its payment obligations and the administration of the plans to one or more insurance companies that manage pension annuities next year , and as part of that transfer the plan will be fully funded , said Rob Six , vice president of communications for the company .
Avery Dennison still offers retirement benefits to employees through a 401(k ) plan .
Beginning this year , the company increased its matching contribution rate for eligible participants to 50 % of the first 7 % of eligible pay .
It also offers an automatic contribution of 3 % of eligible pay .

Bad news : " Top Gun : Maverick " wo n't be buzzing the tower until June 26 , 2020 .
Paramount announced Wednesday that it was delaying the long - awaited sequel 's release date by one year .
It had originally been scheduled for release in July 2019 .
News of the postponement came just one week after Jon Hamm and Ed Harris were added to the cast .
Here 's what else we know about the hotly anticipated project : A female fighter pilot will bust up the boy 's club The Tom Cruise - led sequel brought its first female pilot on board with " Chicago Justice " star Monica Barbaro .
Barbaro will also play the love interest to Miles Teller 's character , a pilot training under Cruise 's Pete " Maverick " Mitchell .
Filming had started before the surprise delay Cruise , 56 , tapped into his 23-year - old Tom Terrific self , signaling on May 30 that filming had begun with a Twitter post featuring the Ray - Bans , the Maverick helmet and a # Day1 " Feel the need " message .
The Department of Defense , no less , confirmed that " Maverick " was shooting at Naval Air Station North Island in San Diego .
After two days of filming away from prying eyes , Cruise jetted off to promote " Mission : Impossible - Fallout " around the world .
Shooting was due to resume in September .
There is no timetable for new shooting with the film 's delay .
Cruise summed up the story to E !
News : " It 's about a guy who flies jets . "
Maverick may have a new love interest Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly will star alongside Cruise in the female lead role , described as a single mom who owns a bar near the base .
Cruise confirmed the casting , promising Connelly will be " amazing " in the movie .
In the original film , Maverick was famously involved with astrophysicist and civilian Top Gun instructor , Charlotte " Charlie " Blackwood .
It 's looking like things did n't work out .
Maverick will team up with Goose 's son " Top Gun " focused on risk - taking pilot Maverick and his family - oriented wingman , Nick " Goose " Bradshaw ( Anthony Edwards ) .
The bromance ended tragically , with Bradshaw dying after ejecting from their stalled jet .
The new film will feature Maverick , now a flight instructor , mentoring Goose 's grown son ( we caught glimpses of the boy in the first movie during the " Great Balls of Fire " performance in the barbecue joint ) .
News of the intense auditions for the coveted role leaked out .
Miles Teller beat out a field that included actors Glen Powell and Nicholas Hoult .
Already showing he 's following in Cruise 's footsteps , Teller tweeted , " I feel the need ... " to confirm the casting .
While there are no points for second place , Powell 's Twitter reaction after losing out was pretty fantastic .
Surprise !
Glen Powell joined the cast In a surprise twist , Paramount confirmed that producers were so impressed with Powell , they 're beefing up a role in the script just for him .
No word yet on what the part will entail , but the " Hidden Figures " star is psyched .
Powell posted a picture on Instagram Aug. 8 .
of himself wearing aviators and a bomber jacket while posing in front of a classic fighter jet . "
Guess some things are nt so classified ... Its now official .
I m headed to TOP GUN , " he wrote .
" This movie is one of the reasons I became an actor .
Its why I always go low after a high - five , always fall in love with my teachers , say things like ' clean 'em and fry 'em on a daily basis , end volleyball games in oiled - up flexing , and why I can blame all my speeding tickets on Kenny Loggins . "
In all seriousness , Powell added that it was a major achievement ten years after moving from Texas to Los Angeles . "
Victories are rare , dreams are mostly broken , so I am truly grateful for everyone in my life who 's helped me beat the odds to get into this flight suit , " he wrote . "
This role is a dream come true . "
Iceman will make a return Cruise 's main " Top Gun " adversary , Tom " Iceman " Kazansky ( Val Kilmer ) , will be back .
Kilmer , who has battled throat cancer , has been playfully campaigning to face off with Cruise on social media and was spotted in " Maverick " headquarters in San Diego .
Kilmer , 58 , confirmed the news on Facebook , saying he was " officially in the sequel . "
He even hinted at a fan 's request to see a replay of the infamous beach volleyball game . "
I ca nt comment on the screenplay , but we all know what we want to see ! "
Kilmer wrote .
Cruise told " Extra " July 11 that working with his former screen rival was " special , " adding that Kilmer is in good health . "
He s doing really well . "
Cruise also teased a " Top Gun 2 " volleyball game . "
There could be a beach scene , " Cruise told " E.T. " on July 12 . "
That 's all I can tell you . "
Maverick is gunning the bike , but it 's a new one Cruise was spotted by TMZ riding a motorcycle on the air base " Maverick " set .
So watch out for a homage to this classic scene .
Maverick has traded in his Kawasaki GPZ900R for a Ninja H2R. List price : $ 55,000 .
As the motorcycle enthusiast site Ride Apart noted , " Maybe Cruise 's character also got a pay raise ? "
BALTIMORE - Just before a wave of violence turned Baltimore into the nations deadliest big city , a curious thing happened to its police force : officers suddenly seemed to stop noticing crime .
Police officers reported seeing fewer drug dealers on street corners .
They encountered fewer people who had open arrest warrants .
Police questioned fewer people on the street .
They stopped fewer cars .
In the space of just a few days in spring 2015 - as Baltimore faced a wave of rioting after Freddie Gray , a black man , died from injuries he suffered in the back of a police van - officers in nearly every part of the city appeared to turn a blind eye to everyday violations .
They still answered calls for help .
But the number of potential violations they reported seeing themselves dropped by nearly half .
It has largely stayed that way ever since . "
What officers are doing is they re just driving looking forward .
They ve got horse blinders on , " says Kevin Forrester , a retired Baltimore detective .
The surge of shootings and killings that followed has left Baltimore easily the deadliest large city in the United States .
Its murder rate reached an all - time high last year ; 342 people were killed .
The number of shootings in some neighborhoods has more than tripled .
One man was shot to death steps from a police station .
Another was killed driving in a funeral procession .
What 's happening in Baltimore offers a view of the possible costs of a remarkable national reckoning over how police officers have treated minorities .
Starting in 2014 , a series of racially charged encounters in Ferguson , Missouri ; Chicago ; Baltimore ; and elsewhere cast an unflattering spotlight on aggressive police tactics toward black people .
Since then , cities have been under pressure to crack down on abuses by law enforcement .
So has the U.S. Justice Department .
During the Obama administration , the department launched wide - ranging civil rights investigations of troubled police forces , then took them to court to compel reforms .
Under President Donald Trump , Washington has largely given up that effort . "
If you want crime to go up , let the ACLU run the police department , " Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a gathering of police officials in May. Whether that scrutiny would cause policing to suffer - or crime to rise - has largely remained an open question .
In Baltimore , at least , the effect on the city 's police force was swift and substantial .
Police typically learn about crime in one of two ways : either someone calls for help , or an officer sees a crime himself and stops to do something .
The second category , known among police as an " on - view , " offers a sense of how aggressively officers are doing their job .
Car stops are a good example : Few people call 911 to report someone speeding - instead , officers see it and choose to pull someone over .
Or choose not to .
POLICING THE USA : A look at race , justice , media Millions of police records show officers in Baltimore respond to calls as quickly as ever .
But they now begin far fewer encounters themselves .
From 2014 to 2017 , dispatch records show the number of suspected narcotics offenses police reported themselves dropped 30 percent ; the number of people they reported seeing with outstanding warrants dropped by half .
The number of field interviews - instances in which the police approach someone for questioning - dropped 70 percent . "
Immediately upon the riot , policing changed in Baltimore , and it changed very dramatically , " says Donald Norris , an emeritus professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County , who reviewed USA TODAY 's analysis . "
The outcome of that change in policing has been a lot more crime in Baltimore , especially murders , and people are getting away with those murders . "
Police officials acknowledge the change . "
In all candor , officers are not as aggressive as they once were , pre-2015 .
Its just that fact , " says acting Police Commissioner Gary Tuggle , who took command of Baltimore 's police force in May. Tuggle blames a shortage of patrol officers and the fallout from a blistering 2016 Justice Department investigation that found the city 's police regularly violated residents ' constitutional rights and prompted new limits on how officers there carry out what had once been routine parts of their job .
At the same time , he says , police have focused more of their energy on gun crime and less on smaller infractions . "
We do nt want officers going out , grabbing people out of corners , beating them up and putting them in jail , " Tuggle says . "
We want officers engaging folks at every level .
And if somebody needs to be arrested , arrest them .
But we also want officers to be smart about how they do that . "
The change has left a perception among some police officers that people in the city are free to do as they please .
And among criminals , says Mahogany Gaines , whose brother , Dontais , was found shot to death inside his apartment in October . "
These people do nt realize that you re leaving people fatherless and motherless , " Gaines says . "
I feel like they think they re untouchable . "
A wave of violence On a sticky morning in May , the Rev. Rodney Hudson slips on a black " Sermonator " T - shirt and walks down the street from his west Baltimore church , a gray stone edifice two blocks from where police arrested Gray .
A few days earlier , a drug crew from another neighborhood set up camp on the corner across the street .
Hudson says the dealers nearly got into a gunfight with the crew that usually works across from the elementary school down the block .
Since Grays death , at least 41 people have been shot within a short walk of Hudsons church . "
Drug dealers are taking control of the corners and the polices hands are tied , " Hudson says . "
We have a community that is afraid . "
Two blocks away , Mayor Catherine Pugh and a knot of city officials are under a tent on an empty lot to break ground for a group of new townhouses .
Police officers linger on the streets , and a helicopter swirls overhead .
But three blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue , drug crews still appear to be at work .
Shouts of " hard body " - one of the drug cocktails on offer - ring clearly .
Another man shouts a warning as Hudson and a reporter approach .
Drug dealers have worked Baltimores street corners for decades .
But Hudson says it has been years since he has seen so many young men selling so brazenly in so many places .
Dealers , he says , " are taking advantage " of a newly timid police force .
At least 150 people have been killed in Baltimore this year .
Ebony Owens son , Decorey Horne , 20 , was shot to death in 2016 in a parked car along the narrow street behind his aunts house .
Another man who was with him was shot but survived .
Eleven months later , the father of Owens ' youngest son , Sherman Carrothers , was found dead outside his house with a gunshot wound .
He was one of four people shot in the city that night .
Owens grew up in Baltimore and knew the city could be dangerous .
But this , she says , is different : " I do nt remember it being like this . " '
These guys are n't stupid ' By almost any measure , this has been a troubled time for Baltimores police force .
It began in April 2015 , when officers in west Baltimore chased Gray , arrested him for possession of what they said was an illegal switchblade and loaded him into the back of a police van , handcuffed but without a seatbelt .
By the time Gray left the van , he was in a coma .
He died a week later .
Protests followed , then riots .
Prosecutors charged six police officers for Grays death but abandoned the case after three were acquitted .
The next year , the Justice Departments civil rights arm accused Baltimores police of arresting thousands of people without a valid legal basis , using unjustified force and targeting black neighborhoods for unconstitutional stops .
Investigators quoted a detective who said he saw officers plant drugs on a suspect , and a patrol officer who said his job was to " be the baddest ( expletive ) out there . "
This year , eight officers in an elite anti - gun unit were convicted in a corruption scandal that included robbing drug dealers and carrying out illegal stops and searches .
One officer testified that a supervisor told them to carry replica guns they could plant on suspects .
Another officer was indicted in January after footage from his body camera showed him acting out finding drugs in an alley .
The citys new police commissioner , Darryl De Sousa , resigned in May after federal prosecutors charged him with failing to pay his income taxes .
For civil rights lawyers and federal investigators , those episodes offer evidence of a police force in trouble and too often willing to trample the rights of minorities .
But some officers drew a different lesson : " Officers no longer put themselves on the firing line , " says Victor Gearhart , a retired lieutenant who supervised the overnight shift in Baltimores southern district before he was pushed out of the department for referring to Black Lives Matter activists as " thugs " in an email . "
These guys are nt stupid .
They realize that if they do something wrong , they re going to get their head bit off .
There s no feeling that anybodys behind them anymore , and they re not going to do it , " he says . "
Nobody wants to put their head in the pizza oven when the pizza oven is on . "
Gearhart and other officers say no one ordered them to make fewer stops or take fewer risks . "
We did n't have to tell them , " he says . "
We just said these are the facts , this is the situation , and if you want to risk your career , have at it . "
That reaction fits a wider pattern .
Nearly three - quarters of police officers who responded to a Pew Research Center survey last year said high - profile incidents had left them less willing to stop and question people who seem suspicious .
Even more said the incidents had made their jobs harder .
It has also drawn scorn from civil rights advocates , who scoff at the idea that police ca nt protect both the city and the rights of its residents . "
What it says is that if you complain about the way the police do our job , maybe well just lay back and not do it as hard , " says Jeffery Robinson , a deputy legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union , which had advocated for an overhaul of police agencies in Baltimore and elsewhere . "
If its true , if that s what officers are doing , they should be fired . "
A sudden change To track the change in Baltimore , USA TODAY examined 5.1 million police dispatches from 2013 to 2017 .
They show that even before Gray died , the number of encounters Baltimore officers initiated on their own was dropping .
But in the weeks after the 25-year - olds death - after protests erupted into riots , and the National Guard came and left - the number of incidents police reported themselves plummeted .
Where once it was common for officers to conduct hundreds of car stops , drug stops and street encounters every day , on May 4 , 2015 , three days after city prosecutors announced that they had filed charges against six officers over Grays death , the number fell to just 79 .
The average number of incidents police reported themselves dropped from an average of 460 a day in March to 225 a day in June of that year , even though summer weather typically brings higher crime .
By the end of last year , it was lower still .
At the same time , violence in the city leapt to historic highs .
Police recorded more than 200 murders and assaults involving guns in May 2015 , triple the number in March .
Criminologists who reviewed the records say its impossible to determine whether that rapid change played a role in the citys rising crime , but some found the pattern troubling . "
The cops are being less proactive at the same time violence is going up , " says Peter Moskos , a John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor and former Baltimore officer who reviewed USA TODAYs data and analysis . "
Cops are doing as requested : lessening racial disparity , lessening complaints , lessening police - involved shootings .
All those numbers are just great right now , and if those are your metrics of success , were winning .
The message has clearly gotten out to not commit unnecessary policing . "
Neither the mayor nor Kevin Davis , the citys police commissioner until January , responded to questions about the changes .
Anthony Barksdale , a retired Baltimore police commander , says the message to officers was unmistakable . "
These guys have family members who tell them ' Do nt go to work and chase people for a city that does nt care about you , ' " he says . "
If I m riding down the street and I see an incident , I see it , but you know what ?
Its not worth it .
That s what these cops are thinking . "
Based on your votes , Brock Lesnar does nt stand a chance against newly crowned UFC heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier .
That s according to the results of our latest Daily Debate poll for MMAjunkie Radio , in which we asked readers and radio listeners to predict the outcome of the planned fight between Cormier ( 21 - 1 MMA , 10 - 1 UFC ) and Lesnar ( 5 - 3 MMA , 4 - 3 UFC ) , which is tentatively scheduled for early 2019 .
While Cormier plans to squeeze in a light - heavyweight title defense before then , UFC officials are clearly banking on Lesnar - a current WWE star who has nt notched an official UFC win since 2010 - to provide a pay - per - view bonanza .
Lesnars merits as a worthy title challenger are understandably thin at best , but the former UFC champion has proven box - office and PPV gold .
Even Cormier knows it , which explains why he wants the fight ( and the hefty payday ) .
Still , is the matchup a competitive one at all ?
The opening odds for Cormier vs. Lesnar have the reigning champ as a modest favorite , but in our Daily Debate poll , the predicted outcome is far more lopsided ( via Twitter ) : Today 's # DailyDebate question for @MMAjunkieRadio : With early betting odds out ( https://t.co/3vE8bXMmPv ) for a @UFC heavyweight title fight between champ Daniel Cormier and Brock Lesnar , what outcome do you see unfolding ? --
MMAjunkie ( @MMAjunkie ) July 10 , 2018 So in total , a whopping 83 percent expect Cormier to win ( 73 percent by stoppage ) and just 17 are siding with Lesnar .
In the video above , the MMAjunkie Radio hosts , as well as in - studio guest host and UFC contender Khalil Rountree , preview the fight and discuss why Cormier is likely the choice for so many fight fans .

Beryl , a tiny , compact storm system in the Atlantic , became the season 's first hurricane Friday but is expected to weaken quickly as it moves westward into the Caribbean .
The National Hurricane Center said Friday morning that the center of Hurricane Beryl , located off the northeast coast of South America , was moving west at 14 mph with sustained winds near 75 mph .
Hurricane - force winds from the compact hurricane extend only 10 miles from the center , with tropical storm force winds stretching only up to 35 miles .
While Beryl was forecast to strengthen during the day , the NHC said it is expected to quickly weaken by late Saturday and become a tropical storm or morph into a " strong open trough " near the Lesser Antilles late Sunday or Monday .
Weather tweet " Strong wind shear , dry air and dust are likely to cause the feature to weaken and may result in a total demise of Beryl , " said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Paul Walker .

Bill Stone talks about current market risks Bill Stone , Stone Investment Partners Chief Investment Officer , discusses what to watch from the Fed and the market reaction
Billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio says artificial intelligence and automation are improving productivity but also causing such a dramatic wealth gap that " a national emergency should be declared . "
The co - chief investment officer and co - chairman of Bridgewater Associates shared his thoughts in a Facebook post on Thursday .
Dalio says he was responding to a question about whether machine intelligence would put enough people out of work that the government will have to pay people to live with a cash handout , a concept known as universal basic income . "
My view is that algorithmic / automated decision making is a two edged sword that is improving total productivity but is also eliminating jobs , leading to big wealth and opportunity gaps and populism , and creating a national emergency . "
Largely as a result of it , capitalism is not working for the majority of Americans and is in jeopardy , " he writes . "
Yet no one is seriously examining what to do about it . "
Indeed , income inequality is real .
The global charity Oxfam found that 82 percent of the growth in global wealth in the previous year went to the top 1 percent of individuals ranked by riches , according to a report published in January .
Meanwhile , the bottom 50 percent had no increase in their wealth , the report says .
Billionaire serial entrepreneur Richard Branson told the New York Times in June that a universal basic income is an appropriate response to income inequality . "
A basic income should be introduced in Europe and in America , " Branson told David Gelles of the Times . "
Its a disgrace to see people sleeping on the streets with this material wealth all around them . "
In particular , Branson said the acceleration of machine intelligence is driving the need of cash payments . "
I think with artificial intelligence coming along , there needs to be a basic income , " said Branson . "
I think AI will result in there being less hours in the day that people are going to need to work , " Branson said . "
You know , three - day workweeks and four - day weekends .
Then were going to need companies trying to entertain people during those four days , and help people make sure that they re paid a decent amount of money for much shorter work time . "
Other billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have also promoted UBI .
And Facebook co - founder Chris Hughes suggested pulling back tax cuts on corporations and the top 1 percent to give $ 500 tax credit to every American who is currently making less than $ 50,000 a year .
But a cash handout should be a last resort , according to Dalio . "
I do nt believe that transferring money to people who are unproductive is good for the people or the economy , unless there are no other good alternatives .
I believe that its both far better and its possible to find ways for making most of these people productive , " says Dalio .
Retraining workers to thrive in the new economy should be a top priority for the country , the financier and entrepreneur says . "
I think that a national emergency should be declared , a special commission created , and metrics established to come up with programs and measurements to make work improvements that more than pay for themselves and measure the changes that are taking place , " Dalio says . "
I know of many cost effective ways that improvements that pay for themselves can be made and I m sure that many others know of many more ways . " (
Dalio did not expound on what those work improvement policies would or should be . )
Dalio , who is currently worth more than $ 17 billion according to Forbes , is not optimistic that the skills gap will be suitably addressed . "
Productivity is good for everyone .
Unfortunately , its not available to everyone .
That has to change .
We need leadership that can bring that about .
Unfortunately , it is more likely that nothing along these lines will be done and , in the next economic downturn , the haves and have nots will be at each others throats , fighting over income redistributions rather than working together to make plans to make most people productive , " he writes . "
For that reason , I m worried about the health of capitalism and democracy . "

Biogen shareholders are rejoicing over a clinical trials positive results .
Shares of the biotech company were up 19.6 percent Friday , a day after Biogen and Tokyo - based Eisai announced positive results from a Phase II study with BAN2401 , an anti - amyloid beta protofibril antibody , in 856 patients with early Alzheimer 's disease .
The stock move added more than $ 12 billion in value to Biogen shares . "
The prospect of being able to offer meaningful disease - modifying therapies to individuals suffering from this terrible disease is both exciting and humbling , " Biogens chief medical officer , Alfred Sandrock , said in a release . "
These BAN2401 18-month data offer important insights in the investigation of potential treatment options for patients with Alzheimer 's disease and underscores that neurodegenerative diseases may not be as intractable as they once seemed . "
J.P. Morgan told its clients the announcement is a good sign for the Biogens pipeline . "
Bigger picture , the data today adds to our confidence that there may indeed be a correlation between amyloid beta levels and cognitive functioning which , in our view , positions BIIB nicely for a potentially substantial wave of anticipation trade well ahead of the future binary aducanumab readouts ( as we believe prevailing levels reflect minimal contribution from Alzheimers ) , " analyst said in a note to clients Thursday .
The analyst reiterated his overweight rating and $ 400 price target for Biogen shares , representing 34 percent upside to Thursdays close .
The company had a market value of $ 63 billion as of Thursdays close .
Biogen shares were down 6 percent this year through Thursday versus the S&P 500s 2 percent gain .
Bitcoin began the week higher , climbing as much as 5 % , following reports that the worlds largest asset manager was considering a push into the digital - currency market .
The Financial News reported Monday that BlackRock , which has more than $ 6 trillion under management , has put together a team to explore potential investments in digital currencies and blockchain , the underlying technology that drives cryptocurrencies .
Cryptocurrencies are in the midst of a tough run , with bitcoin , the worlds largest digital currency , down more than 50 % year to date as it grapples with widespread adoption .
A move by BlackRock would be a major coup for proponents . "
It makes sense given recent market action , " said Mati Greenspan , senior market analyst at eToro . "
In November as prices were moving higher firms like the Cboe CBOE , -1.43 % were in a rush to get on the train , but now that things have quieted down , traditional investment firms are beginning to dip their toes into the space . "
While the asset management firm may be exploring ways to get exposure to the nascent technology , BlackRocks CEO Larry Fink said he has nt seen the enthusiasm from the client side . "
I do nt believe any client has sought out crypto exposure , " Fink said on Bloomberg Television Monday .
The news pushed the price of bitcoin BTCUSD , -0.82 % above $ 6,500 , trading to an intraday high of $ 6,698.35 .
A single bitcoin last changed hands at $ 6,663.09 , up 4.6 % since Sunday 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the Kraken crypto exchange .

The popular payments app Square has pulled its application for a license to be an industrial loan company for the time being .
It filed that application last year with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. A license would allow it to perform some of the same services as banks , such as taking in deposits .
In May , Square CEO Jack Dorsey said customers were using the Cash app like a bank account , and Square had plans to seize on that trend .
The news about the FDIC application was first reported by American Banker , around the time the slide in bitcoin began Thursday afternoon .
Square said in a statement to CNBC that its application with the Utah Department of Financial Institutions was still active and that it would refile the FDIC application after amending and strengthening it . "
Square Capital is uniquely positioned to build a bridge between the financial system and the underserved , and we continue to work closely with the FDIC and Utah DFI on our applications , " the statement said .
In June , New York financial regulators granted Square the go - ahead to allow New Yorkers to trade cryptocurrency on its Cash app .
BOEs Saunders : Underlying UK economy continues to grow Michael Saunders , a member of the Bank of Englands monetary policy committee , explains why he is for hiking rates .
BOISE , Idaho - As he prepares to snap a more than year - long layoff , UFC Fight Night 133 headliner Junior Dos Santos is happy , ready and looking forward to the " bright future " ahead .
For the UFCs former heavyweight champion to get here , though , he first had to overcome a very different type of fight : the one for his reputation , after the U.S. Anti - Doping Agency flagged him for a potential doping violation last August . "
That was the biggest fight , to fight for my reputation and everything that I believe and everything that I said before , " Dos Santos told MMAjunkie ahead of Saturdays FS1-televised headliner against Blagoy Inanov . "
Because I was loud , always supporting USADA , and then everything was happening against me . (
I d never seen ) myself going through something like that .
But it was happening , and I had to deal with that .
It was a very bad moment of my career , of my life . "
Dos Santos previously talked to MMAjunkie about his ordeal in detail .
While it had a happy ending , as he was able to show that the traces of the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide found on his body were the result of tainted supplements , it was a long , costly process .
Between the time he was flagged and the time he was publicly cleared of wrong - doing , nine months elapsed .
The feelings as he awaited a resolution were mixed : As confident as he was that things would eventually get sorted out , the Brazilian knew there was a limit to what he could do to prove he was innocent should they end up determining he was nt .
As shown by the fact that Dos Santos ( 18 - 5 MMA , 12 - 4 UFC ) gets to meet Ivanov ( 16 - 1 - 1 MMA , 0 - 0 UFC ) on Saturday at CenturyLink Arena in Boise , Idaho , things did work out .
He took a six - month suspension and proved that he had nt knowingly cheated .
Dos Santos still supports USADAs efforts toward a cleaner sport , though maybe with some adjustments - especially in the way they go about cases like his , in which the minimal amounts indicate contamination from the get - go .
Still , he ca nt shake some things off . "
Of course I m afraid now , " Dos Santos said . "
Every time they get in my house , I m nervous .
Because I do nt know .
I was nt doing anything wrong before .
There s nothing to learn .
They asked me , ' What have you learned from that ?
Nothing .
I was doing everything right .
I was doing everything the best I could . "
I do nt take any type of drug .
I do nt drink alcohol .
I do nt smoke .
I do nt do anything like this .
They say I m a boring guy , but I m a very happy guy , actually . "
Even amid the uncertainty , Dos Santos never stopped showing up for practice at American Top Team .
That allowed him to follow his plan to return as soon as he was cleared to do so .
Given the name of former WSOF champion Ivanov , " JDS " did nt wince .
Taking on a promotional newcomer might seem like an oddly risky decision for a former champion looking to make his way to the top .
But , quite frankly , Dos Santos was nt too concerned as to who d be the one standing across him inside the cage . "
I love this sport , " Dos Santos said . "
I love who I am .
To be here , to be Junior Dos Santos , for me - I ca nt see myself doing anything else right now .
I m 34 years old , young . "
Gallery Photos : Best of Junior Dos Santos view 18 images Dos Santos kept watching fights , too , and knows quite well that he s returning at an interesting time for the division .
Just last Saturday , a new champion was crowned , when now two - division champion Daniel Cormier beat Stipe Miocic the UFC 226 headliner .
For someone like Dos Santos , who had a failed title shot in a rematch against Miocic , the fact that there s new leader atop the division can be a good sign .
And while that s not lost on him , Dos Santos is still eyeing that trilogy with his fellow fallen champ . "
When you become the champion , you become a target , " Dos Santos said . "
Now , the new target for the heavyweight division is Daniel Cormier .
Everybody , of course , wants to fight him . ,
including me .
And eventually , at some point , its going to happen .
But the division is living a good moment .
I want to do this third fight with Miocic , too . "
That could be a good fight for one of these shows .
There are many good fights .
The heavyweight division is living a good moment and we can give the fans a lot of excitement . "
With Cormiers next heavyweight title defense pretty much set to occur against Brock Lesnar , what if Dos Santos desired Miocic trilogy served to elect a No .
1 contender ? "
I would love that , " Dos Santos said , adding with a laugh . "
I was nt thinking about that , but that s a good idea .
Our third fight and then the winner fights for the title , maybe .
Good . "

Branson bands together in wake of duck boat tragedy All but the two crew members who were on the duck boat that sank in Branson , Missouri , with 31 people on board were tourists .
But Branson is a town where in some ways there are no strangers .
Dana Jacboson reports .
Branson duck boat accident : Captain among the survivors Thirteen are confirmed dead after a tour boat capsized and sank on a lake near Branson , Missouri , during a powerful storm on Thursday .
Four of the 31 total passengers who were aboard the duck boat are still missing .
At a news briefing Friday morning , Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said that the captain of the boat was among the survivors .
Branson , Missouri duck boat accident : 13 dead , 4 still missing Thirteen people are dead after a tour boat carrying 31 passengers capsized and sank on Table Rock Lake near Branson , Missouri , during a powerful thunderstorm .
Some of the victims are children .
Police say four of them are still missing .
Kenneth Craig reports .
BRANSON , Mo. -- More than half of the 17 people killed when a tourist boat sank on a lake in Missouri were members of the same Indiana family , and they likely would not have been on the ill - fated trip but for a ticket mix - up .
Others who died in the accident at Table Rock Lake included a Missouri couple who had recently celebrated a birthday , a longtime Rhode Island pastor who was operating the boat , and an Indiana father and son .
The Stone County Sheriff 's Department identified the Indiana family members as 45-year - old Angela Coleman , 1-year - old Arya Coleman , 69-year - old Belinda Coleman , 76-year - old Ervin Coleman , 7-year - old Evan Coleman , 40-year - old Glenn Coleman , 70-year - old Horace Coleman , 2-year - old Maxwell Coleman , and 9-year - old Reece Coleman .
A relative of the family , Kim Thomas Sr . ,
said they 're taking the news hard . "
The kids are doing better than we are .
We have to live in this world ; they have gone to the other side , " said Thomas , 51 , of Indianapolis , whose cousin , Tia Coleman , was one of two members of the family to survive the accident at Table Rock Lake near Branson .
Coleman said the boat 's captain told them " do n't worry about grabbing the life jackets .
You wo n't need them " -- so none of the family members grabbed them . "
However in doing that , when it was time to grab them , it was too late and I believe that a lot of people could have been spared , " she told CBS Indianapolis affiliate WTTV . "
The only thing that I would like to be done but ca n't , is to bring my family back . "
Others who died were 69-year - old William Asher , 68-year - old Rosemarie Hamann , 63-year - old Janice Bright , 65-year - old William Bright , and the crew member operating the boat , 73-year - old Bob Williams , all from Missouri .
Also killed were 64-year - old Leslie Dennison of Illinois , and 53-year - old Steve Smith and his son , 15-year - old Lance Smith , both from Arkansas .
State and federal investigators were trying to determine what sent the vessel known as a duck boat to its demise in what was the deadliest accident of its kind in early two decades .
An initial assessment blamed thunderstorms and winds that approached hurricane strength , but it was n't clear why the amphibious vehicle even ventured into the water .
The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm watch for the area Thursday , saying conditions were ripe for winds of 70 mph .
It followed up at 6:32 p.m. with a severe thunderstorm warning for three counties that included Branson and the lake .
The warning mentioned both locations .
The boat went down about 40 minutes later , shortly after 7 p.m. Suzanne Smagala with Ripley Entertainment , which owns Ride the Ducks in Branson , said the company was assisting authorities with their investigation .
She said this was the company 's only accident in more than 40 years of operation .
Twenty - nine passengers and two crew members were aboard .
Seven of the 14 survivors were hurt .
The captain survived , authorities said .
Among the injured was 14-year - old Loren Smith of Osceola , Arkansas .
Her father , retired math teacher Steve Smith , and her brother died in the accident .
Loren suffered a concussion . "
It 's a hard thing , " Steve Smith 's father , Carroll Smith , said of losing his only child and his only grandson . "
It 's a very difficult day . "
Branson Mayor Karen Best said Williams , the boat driver , was known by many as " Captain Bob " and was a " great ambassador " for the city . "
He was at every event .
He knew everyone .
He was always promoting Branson , " Best said .
Williams ' family in Rhode Island , where he 'd lived for decades before retiring to Branson , remembered him as a deeply religious man who founded a local church . "
Pastor Bob was a prince of a man , loving , kind , and generous , whose loss to our family is incalculable , " said Williams ' son - in - law , Bishop Jeffery Williams , who now leads King 's Cathedral in Providence . "
I truly believe in my heart that he died trying to save those people , " one of Williams ' neighbors , Charlie ' Ray ' Revill , said at a vigil Friday night . "
Bob Williams was the finest man I 've ever known . "
Hamann and Asher , a St. Louis - area couple killed in the accident , had been celebrating Hamman 's birthday earlier in the week .
Her final Facebook photo was a selfie with Asher .
He 's sticking his tongue out , and she 's smiling .
Friend Russ McKay said he talked to Hamann the day before the accident to say they had just gone on a paddle boat and were planning to go again .
He does n't know why they chose the duck boat instead . "
I can only imagine what they were going through .
They were so in love .
It 's just heartbreaking , " McKay said .
An email message seeking comment from Ripley Entertainment about Coleman 's comment was not immediately returned .
Named for their ability to travel on land and in water , duck boats have been involved in other serious accidents in the past , including the deaths of more than 40 people since 1999 .
The Ride the Ducks tour begins in downtown Branson , where the vehicles take passengers on a tour while the captain cracks jokes and points out landmarks .
Eventually , the boats pull up to the lake and slowly enter the water with a small splash .
After a few minutes on the water , the vehicles return to land and to their home base , which features a store selling candy and souvenirs .
People pray around a van believed to belong to victims of a duck boat accident in the parking lot of the business running the boat tours Friday , July 20 , 2018 in Branson , Missouri .

Breathing might get more expensive if the U.S.-China trade dispute continues to escalate .
Playing baseball could get costlier , as well .
Staying dry in a storm would hit the pocketbook harder , too .
Oxygen , baseball gloves and raincoats are three of the thousands of Chinese goods that would be subject to new tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump as the clash intensifies .
The wide - ranging list of targeted products amounts to about $ 200 billion in goods sold to Americans every year , representing about 40 percent of total U.S. imports from China .
Trump is threatening 10 percent tariffs on this round of goods .
The administration has already imposed 25 percent tariffs on $ 50 billion in Chinese imports , prompting blow - for - blow retaliation from the Chinese government .
Tariffs are effectively a tax on imports .
They often result in increased prices as businesses pass along extra costs to their customers , though some companies choose to absorb the impact instead .

Brian Melley Associated Press LOS ANGELES - A California federal judge on Monday rejected the Trump administrations efforts to detain immigrant families for long terms , calling it a " cynical attempt " to undo a longstanding court settlement .
U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee said the federal government had failed to present new evidence to support revising a court order that limits detaining children who crossed the border illegally for extended periods .
The Department of Justice asked Gee to alter a 1997 settlement , which provides the framework for how to handle detained immigrant children , so it could detain families together for longer periods .
The Trump administration said Gees previous rulings had made family detention unlikely and provided an incentive for a surge of immigrants to bring children across the border illegally with the expectation they would nt be locked up .
DNA tests : Used to reunite migrant families , spark worries they 'll be used for much more White House : Trump administration will miss first deadline to reunify families Separated at the border : Asylum seeker pleads for son 's return Gee called the administrations request " a cynical attempt " to shift responsibility to the court " for over 20 years of Congressional inaction and ill - considered executive action that have led to the current stalemate . "
Three years ago , Gee rejected a similar effort by the Obama administration .
She ruled at the time that immigrant children generally ca nt be held longer than 20 days .
More than 2,000 children were separated from their parents by U.S. immigration authorities at the border with Mexico this spring before President Donald Trump reversed course on June 20 amid an international outcry .
The application to change the Flores agreement - named for an El Salvador immigrant who was 15 when the case was brought in 1985 - was " procedurally improper and wholly without merit , " said Gee , who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama .
The Department of Justice was reviewing Mondays ruling and did not say if it would appeal . "
We disagree with the courts ruling declining to amend the Flores Agreement to recognize the current crisis of families making the dangerous and unlawful journey across our southern border , " spokesman Devin OMalley said in a statement .
Families can be detained together if their parents waive their right to release children to the custody of a family member .
Attorney Peter Schey , who represents detained children in the settlement , said President Donald Trump had falsely claimed the settlement required the separation of families . "
Sifting through the governments false narrative , the court clearly found that the Flores settlement has never resulted in the separation of families , " Schey said . "
President Trump needs to take responsibility for his own misguided policies . "
The ruling came the same day the government acknowledged it would not meet a Tuesday deadline set by a San Diego federal judge who ordered detained children under 5 to be reunited with their families .
Justice Department lawyer Sarah Fabian said 54 of the 100 or so infants and toddlers covered by the order would be reunited on time .
She said the delay for others was due to a variety of reasons , including that the parents of some of the youngsters had already been deported .
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw , a nominee of Republican President George W. Bush , set a July 26 deadline to reunite all the children separated from their parents .
The government had claimed in its filings that Sabraws ruling trumped the Flores agreement .
Gee rejected that argument on several grounds , saying the U.S. was relying on a " tortured interpretation " of the deal .

Britain 's Prime Minister Theresa May Frank Augstein | Pool | Reuters British Prime Minister Theresa May secured a cabinet agreement on Friday for her plans to leave the European Union , overcoming rifts among her ministers to win support for " a business - friendly " proposal aimed at spurring stalled Brexit talks .
After an hours - long meeting at her Chequers country residence , May seemed to have persuaded the most vocal Brexit campaigners in her cabinet to back her plan to press for " a free trade area for goods " with the EU .
The agreed proposal - which also says Britain 's large services sector will not have the current levels of access to EU markets - will not come soon enough for Brussels , which has been pressing May to come up with a detailed vision for future ties .
But the hard - won compromise may yet fall flat with EU negotiators By also committing to ending free movement of people , the supremacy of the European court and " vast " payments to the bloc , May could be accused of " cherry - picking " the best bits of the EU by Brussels officials , who are determined to send a strong signal to other countries not to follow Britain out of the door .
For now , May , who has been written off by critics regularly since losing her Conservative Party 's parliamentary majority in an ill - judged election last year , will be buoyed by the hard - won agreement . "
Today in detailed discussions the cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU , " May said in a statement . "
Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve . "
In a document outlining the government 's position , ministers said they had agreed that an earlier proposal made to the EU " needed to evolve in order to provide a precise , responsible and credible basis for progressing negotiations " Instead , they had agreed to negotiate for a " free trade area for goods " , one that would see Britain having a " common rulebook for all goods " in a combined customs territory .
This would allow Britain to set its own import tariffs and seal new free trade deals .
They also agreed that parliament would have the power to decide whether to follow EU rules and regulations in the future , and the government would step up preparations for the eventuality of a ' no deal ' exit .

BRUSSELS - President Donald Trump aired his grievances against one of America 's closest and most powerful allies on Wednesday , deepening the growing rifts on the North Atlantic alliance and setting a contentious tone for a summit of NATO leaders who have pledged to defend each other in the event of an attack from Russia .
And he did it all over breakfast .
Trump 's guest : NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg . "
I think the Secretary General likes Trump , " the president said , before sitting down in the dining room of a diplomatic mission in Brussels . "
He may be the only one , but that 's okay with me . "
But the moment they sat down , it became clear that Trump did not come to Brussels in a conciliatory mood . "
Good morning to the media - the legitimate media and the fake - news media , " Trump began .
With cameras whirring in unison , a reporter asked Trump which countries he thought should be paying more for the collective defense of NATO . "
Just look at the chart .
Take a look at the chart .
It 's public .
And many countries are not paying what they should , " Trump said . "
So something has to be done , and the Secretary General has been working on it very hard . "
Stoltenberg , sitting directly across from Trump at the breakfast table , said NATO allies had reversed their post - Cold War declines in defense spending and were now engaged in the biggest military buildup in a generation . "
And why was that ? "
Trump asked . "
It 's also because of your leadership , " Stoltenberg said . "
They wo n't write that , but that 's okay , " Trump said , nodding to the press .
Soon , Trump was no longer addressing the media but looking directly at Stoltenberg , using him as a stand - in for German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
He complained about a gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany that the German government approved . "
Germany is totally controlled by Russia , because they will be getting from 60 to 70 percent of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline , " Trump complained .
Fidgeting , looking away At the end of the table sat Chief of Staff John Kelly , who began to fidget as Trump went after Germany .
He took notes , straightened his tie , adjusted the napkin in his lap , scooted his chair and looked away .
White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders later said that Kelly " was displeased because he was expecting a full breakfast and there were only pastries and cheese . "
As Trump continued his harrangue , Stoltenberg diplomatically attempted to bring Trump back to what was supposed to be the theme of this year 's NATO summit . "
Strength and unity . " "
You know , NATO is an alliance of 29 nations , and there are sometimes differences and different views , and also some disagreements , " the secretary general told Trump . "
And the gas pipeline from Russia to Germany is one issue where allies disagree .
But the strength of NATO is that despite these differences , we have always been able to unite around our core task , to protect and defend each other , because we understand that we are stronger together than apart . "
Trump shot back . "
But how can you be together when a country is getting its energy from the person you want protection against or from the group that you want protection ? " "
Because we understand that when we stand together , also in dealing with Russia , we are stronger .
I think what we have seen is that - " Trump interrupted . "
No , you 're just making Russia richer .
You 're not dealing with Russia .
You 're making Russia richer . " "
Well , I think that even during the Cold War , NATO Allies were trading with Russia , " Stoltenberg said . "
I think trade is wonderful .
I think energy is a whole different story .
I think energy is a much different story than normal trade , " Trump said . "
Germany , as far as I 'm concerned , is captive to Russia , because it 's getting so much of its energy from Russia .
So we 're supposed to protect Germany , but they 're getting their energy from Russia .
Explain that .
And it ca n't be explained - you know that . "
With that , reporters were escorted out of the breakfast .
Outside , White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump would meet face - to - face with Merkel later in the day - and would make the same complaints directly to her .
But when that meeting came , Trump 's tone seemed to shift .
He acknowledged bringing up the pipeline issue , " We have a tremendous relationship with Germany , " he said . "
But we 'll see what happens over the next period of a few months . "
Merkel , for her part , said only that she was " very pleased indeed to have this opportunity for an exchange of views . "
Asked about how the breakfast went later , Stoltenberg quipped that he had " eggs and toast and orange juice and some good fruit salad - and it was paid for by the United States . "
BRUSSELS - President Donald Trump unleashed his harshest broadside yet against a European ally on Wednesday , accusing Germany of being " totally controlled by Russia " and of not meeting its obligations to the NATO alliance . "
Germany , as far I m concerned , is captive to Russia , " Trump said .
Trump 's extraordinary rhetoric signaled that he would continue his aggressive , America - first attitude toward the United States ' closest allies - even as he himself prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week in an effort to improve U.S.-Russian relations .
Speaking to reporters after Trumps remarks , German Chancellor Angela Merkel shot back that she would not be lectured about Russian control of Germany , having grown up in the Soviet - dominated East Germany . "
I have experienced myself how a part of Germany was controlled by the Soviet Union , " she said , without mentioning Trump by name .
Trump 's verbal attack on Germany came in his first official event in Brussels Wednesday , setting a combative tone for the two - day summit of the alliance in Brussels .
He leaves Brussels for two days in London Thursday , followed by a weekend in Scotland and his summit with Putin in Helsinki next Monday .
More : Trump 's Europe trip : Where he 's going on his 7-day visit with NATO allies and Putin The tense start to the NATO summit followed a contentious Group of Seven summit in Canada last month , when Trump refused to sign on to a routine joint declaration calling for a reduction in tariffs .
Trump has criticized European allies for not spending what they agreed to on defense .
Under a 2014 agreement , NATO set that amount at 2 percent of each country 's economic output .
But Trump upped the ante in a closed - door meeting with allies Wednesday , demanding they double that amount to 4 percent of gross domestic product .
At a current spending level of 3.5 percent , even the United States does not meet that mark .
Germany spends just 1.24 percent on defense .
But Trump also lambasted Germany 's support for a pipeline that would bring Russian natural gas through the Baltic Sea to central Europe . "
So we 're supposed to protect Germany , but they 're getting their energy from Russia .
Explain that .
And it ca n't be explained , " he said .
The Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a commercial venture , but the German government has given its approval to the project .
After a face - to - face meeting with Merkel later , Trump said the gas pipeline came up but seemed to shift his tone . "
We have a very , very good relationship with the chancellor , we have a tremendous relationship with Germany , " he said .
A stoic Merkel responded , " I am pleased to have this opportunity to be here for this exchange of views . "
Merkel emphasized the German role in fighting alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan and its commitment to the collective defense .
More : As he arrives at NATO summit , President Trump hounds allies over ' delinquent ' defense spending Trump 's comments prompted both the House and Senate to introduce non - binding resolutions affirming U.S. support for the alliance .
The Senate resolution passed 97 - 2 . "
I subscribe to the view that we should not be criticizing our president while he is overseas , " said House Speaker Paul Ryan , R - Wis . "
But let me say a couple things .
NATO is indispensable .
Its as important today as it ever has been . "
Ryan said he has concerns about the Germany - Russia gas pipeline and has brought those up privately in his own meetings with European allies .
Democrats , however , called Trump 's insults of Germany an " embarassment . " "
His behavior this morning is another profoundly disturbing signal that the president is more loyal to President Putin than to our NATO allies , " said a statement from the House and Senate Democratic leaders , Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California and Sen. Charles Schumer of New York .
Trump has linked defense and trade throughout his presidency , using national security powers to impose tariffs against close allies like Canada and trade deficits as an argument for cutting U.S. defense aid to Europe .
At NATO , Trump pressed his recurring complaint that European allies are n't paying enough toward the common defense of the alliance .
A new NATO analysis released Tuesday shows only five of the 29 allies - the United States , the United Kingdom , Greece , Estonia and Latvia - meet the benchmark of 2 percent of economic output spent on defense . "
Just look at the chart , " Trump said at the breakfast . "
Many countries are not paying what they should .
And , frankly , many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money for many years back , where they 're delinquent , as far as I 'm concerned , because the United States has had to pay for them . "
That complaint is a misrepresentation of the 2014 agreement reached at a summit in Wales .
While each country agreed to strive for the 2 percent mark within 10 years , that spending is supposed to be on their own defense and is not paid to the United States or NATO directly .
There was no provision made for making up deficiencies in past years .
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg credited Trump with helping to prompt the largest defense buildup in Europe since the end of the Cold War . "
He has a clear message , I think , that has increased interest and understanding of defense spending , and what we ve seen is that defense spending has started to increase , " Stoltenberg said . "
So that 's what I have to say about that . "
In a joint declaration signed by all 29 allies , NATO reaffirmed the Wales commitments but acknowledged that " unprecedented progress " has been made by that goal .
Unlike the G-7 , the United States signed on to the NATO declaration , making it unanimous .
In other business at the summit , NATO agreed to begin the process of allowing the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to join the alliance as its 30th member -- but only if the country changing its name to North Macedonia .
Greece has blocked the accession process over the name issue because many Greeks identify as Macedonians . "
There 's no way to join NATO without changing the name , " Stoltenberg said .
The alliance also committed to leave the door open for other countries to join eventually - if they agree to certain political reforms .
Those countries include Bosnia and Herzegovina , Georgia and Ukraine .

BRUSSELS -- President Donald Trump arrived Tuesday at the home of NATO headquarters with a seemingly singular preoccupation : allies who are n't sharing in the burden of providing for the collective defense .
His rallying cry : " 2 percent . "
That 's the amount NATO members are expected to spend on defense as a share of their economies .
Only four of 29 allies meet that target .
The latest salvo came in two tweets from Air Force One , in which he misrepresented the arrangement by which allies contribute to their joint defense .
The squabbling over who pays for the protection afforded by the alliance has already set a combative tone for the two - day NATO summit in Brussels this week , as the allies discuss its response to Russia 's growing military , political and cyber incursions into Europe . "
Many countries in NATO , which we are expected to defend , are not only short of their current commitment of 2 % ( which is low ) , but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made .
Will they reimburse the U.S. ? "
Trump tweeted .
A 2014 agreement did require members to increase defense spending , with a goal of contributing 2 percent of the nation 's economic output by 2024 .
But more importantly , that spending is on their own defense forces -- not payments to the United States .
But Trump is correct that only four NATO members -- the United States , the United Kingdom , Estonia and Greece -- currently meet the 2 percent expectation .
A fifth country , Poland , fell to 1.99 percent his year , as faster - than - expected economic growth outpaced defense budgets .
Diplomats say Trump 's singular focus on the 2 percent benchmark might be counterproductive . "
The more he harangues allies , and the more he makes this the defining issue , the more difficult it will be for some allies actually to increase spending , " said Ivo Daalder , the U.S. ambassador to NATO from 2009 to 2013 . "
Given that Trumps popularity in Europe is at an historic low for a US president , acceding to his demands is becoming more difficult for many European leaders . "
European Council President Donald Tusk suggested as much Tuesday . "
Dear America , appreciate your allies .
After all , you do nt have that many , " he said in Brussels ahead of Trump 's visit . "
We do have a lot of allies , but we can not be taken advantage of , " Trump responded . "
We 're being taken advantage of by the European Union . "
Trump has tied the issue of defense spending to his larger trade wars , saying the United States should not be subsidizing nations with which it runs a trade deficit . "
The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe ( U.S. has a $ 151 Billion trade deficit ) , and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO , and nicely pay for it , " Trump tweeted . "
Just does nt work ! "
One particular target of Trump 's displeasure has been German Chancellor Angela Merkel . "
Germany pays 1 percent .
One percent , " Trump said at a campaign rally last week . "
And I said , you know , Angela , I ca n't guarantee it , but we 're protecting you , and it means a lot more to you than protecting us because I do n't know how much protection we get by protecting you . "
Germany 's actual spending is 1.24 percent of its gross domestic product .
But experts say Trump 's focus on the percentage of defense spending only captures one dimension of an ally 's contribution .
Germany 's government , for example , approved an increase in troops to serve in Afghanistan , to 1,300 .
And other countries include military pensions in its totals , which is effectively spending on past defense .
Trump 's excessive fixation on defense spending ignores those contributions , argues Jeffrey Rathke , the co - author of a recent study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies on NATO burden sharing .
He also said the NATO figures do n't take into account civilian spending that helps boost defense , like diplomatic efforts and training of local defense forces .
Trump 's frequent complaints about defense spending also obscure the fact that European defense spending is going up -- even by Trump 's own measure .
Nineteen of the 29 members spend more on defense than they did in 2014 , and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said half are on pace to meet the target by 2024 .
There are a lot of reasons for that : New threats from Russia following its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 , an improving European economy , and U.S. pressure under both President Barack Obama and , more pointedly , Trump . "
Trump can claim some credit for the increase , " said Daalder , Obama 's NATO ambassador . "
The allies are certainly willing to give it to him if he were to recommit fully to NATO and collective defense . "
Buckingham Research analyst Matthew Harrigan downgraded shares of Netflix Inc. NFLX , -3.76 % to underperform from neutral ahead of the company 's second - quarter earnings report Monday afternoon .
Though Harrigan projects above - consensus subscriber numbers for the quarter , he generally sees " optimistic forecasts " for Netflix subscriber additions as being priced into the stock . "
Even if Netflix Google search activity suggests a possible beat we would use another post - earnings pop to take profits , " he wrote .
Harrigan is also concerned about competition from other streaming - video services , particularly overseas . "
India is especially intense - with entrants like market leader Hotstar priced at just $ 3 a month , including sports , as well as Amazon Prime , " he wrote .
Harrigan raised his price target to $ 333 from $ 301 , though the new target is 16 % lower that Netflix 's Friday closing price .
Among 44 analysts tracked by FactSet and who cover Netflix , just four rate the stock the equivalent of a sell .
Shares are up 0.4 % in premarket trading and up 146 % over the past 12 months , while the S&P 500 s[x has gained 14 % .
Buckle up , because Tesla could be in for a bumpy ride this week .
The automaker said on Sunday that it pushed out 5000 Model 3 cars , producing a total of 7000 vehicles in the latest week .
Tesla reportedly raced against the clock to meet that goal , momentarily alleviating pressure on CEO Elon Musk .
Still , at least one bearish Tesla investor is steering clear . "
I would nt touch it going into these production dates and delivery dates , " Michael Bapis , managing director at The Bapis Group at Hightower Advisors , told CNBCs " Trading Nation " on Friday . "
They have yet to meet one production or one delivery and there s a massive cash burn on the bottlenecks in the production so I would stay as far away from Tesla as possible . "
Tesla has struggled to meet high demand and often undershoots its own and analysts targets .
During a recent shareholder meeting , Musk forecast a production rate of 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of June .
Although Musk said the company met that goal , Tesla began this quarter producing only 2,000 Model 3s a week .
There is one thing , however , that could change Bapis mind . "
Lets get everything they re saying they re going to do done , and that would change my mind on the company , " he said .
Gina Sanchez , CEO of Chantico Global , was more forgiving of Teslas disappointments . "
Tesla has delivered ; they just simply have nt delivered up to the expectations put on them , " Sanchez told CNBC on Friday . "
Were looking at a situation where people are really , really paying forward for really big expectations and that is probably their biggest strength and weakness . "
Tesla shares biggest gains have been largely based on the promise of a future payoff , as its failed to post a quarterly profit since its third quarter of 2016 .
It has never posted a full - year profit in eight years as a publicly - traded company . "
The pricing has left absolutely no margin for error , " Sanchez added . "
For people who bought it at a lower price and have ridden it up , great .
But if you re coming in at this point you are making a big bet with very little room for any error . "
Friday marked the 8th anniversary of its IPO .
Since making its market debut at $ 17 a share , Tesla has surged 1,917 percent .
BUDAPEST , Hungary -- Luxury purveyor Crystal Cruises continued its rapid move into river cruising on Wednesday with the christening of its fifth new river ship in less than two years .
Hungarian producer Mariann Peller served as godmother for the 106-passenger vessel , Crystal Ravel , during a music - filled event along the waterfront of Budapest . "
I am honored to become part of the Crystal family as this company embodies ... dedication to excellence , " Peller told around 100 invited guests before pulling on a rope to send a bottle of Austrian sparkling wine smashing against Ravel 's hull .
Born in Budapest , Peller created " Virtuosos , " a hit Hungarian television show that 's billed as the worlds first classical music talent show on television .
Versions of the show are being developed for the U.S. and U.K. markets .
Peller also founded the Young Virtuosos Foundation , which promotes the study of classical music by young artists .
The christening event concluded with an on - board performance by Young Virtuosos artists .
It also featured a ship - side performance by European tenor Steffan Mullan .
The christening of Ravel comes just two months after Crystal christened its fourth river ship , Crystal Debussy , at a ceremony in Amsterdam .
The line 's first river ship , Crystal Mozart , debuted in July 2016 with two more Crystal river vessels arriving in 2017 .
All five of the ships sail in Europe .
A longtime leader in luxury ocean cruising , Crystal is bringing a new level of luxury to river cruising with its new river vessels .
Ravel and its sister ships feature by far the most spacious rooms on Europe 's rivers and an unprecedented level of service .
RELATED : The adventure of a Crystal voyage to South Africa Ravel , Debussy and the two Crystal river vessels that debuted in 2017 each have a crew of 68 people to serve 106 passengers -- a far higher ratio than exists on any other river ship in Europe .
The ships also have much more space devoted to their kitchens than typical river ships in Europe , as well as more kitchen staff , allowing for a level of made - to - order cuisine that until now has been unknown in European river cruising . "
I 've been in the cruise industry for quite a long time , and I have seen many , many new ships launched on waters around the world , and I can tell you what Crystal has accomplished here in this short time frame is astonishing , " Crystal Cruises president and CEO Tom Wolber told attendees at Wednesday 's christening .
Wolber took the reigns at Crystal just nine months ago after years as a top executive at Disney Cruise Line and other divisions of Disney .
Crystal bills Ravel and its sister ships as the only river vessels in Europe where every cabin is a suite with a balcony .
Every room on the ships features a panoramic , wall - to - wall window that slides open from the top to create a balcony - like feel .
Other hallmarks of the rooms include king size beds ( relatively rare on river ships ) and , in most rooms , walk - in closets .
Butler service also comes with every cabin category .
Like its sister ships , Ravel features three eateries .
There 's a stylish main restaurant called Waterside and a more casual outlet called Bistro Ravel .
There 's also a private dining room with a single large table called The Vintage Room that can be reserved for extra - charge wine - and - food - pairing lunches and dinners .
Ravel 's inaugural season will include sailings between Budapest ; Basel , Switzerland ; Vienna , Austria ; and Nuremburg , Germany along the Danube , Main and Rhine rivers .
The itineraries feature stops in Hungary , Austria , Germany , Switzerland and Slovakia .
Crystal now operates two ocean ships ( Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony ) , five river ships and a luxury yacht as well as an all - first - class Boeing 777 available for private charter .
It 's also developing an expedition cruising division with its first expedition ship due in 2020 .

Build - a - Bear 's one day sale was so successful it was shut down -- in some places , just hours after it began . "

Busy Philipps , the actor and mega Instagram star who shares exactly what 's on her mind , face , hair or anything else if you 've seen her posts , once hid something so scary , she kept it from her parents .
Her anxiety .
Philipps , 39 , says her anxiety was so fierce she could n't sleep or even steal out of bed to tell her parents .
The Freaks and Geeks , Cougar Town and Vice Principals actor shared her experience with anxiety as part of the Child Mind Institute 's # MyYoungerSelf campaign . "
I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember , since I was a kid .
I used to lie awake in bed at night , and I would have spinning thoughts .
It would be really hard for me to get to sleep , and I would be so scared that I would n't even go to my parents ' room .
And I did n't want to tell them what was happening because I thought there was something wrong with me . " '
Nothing wrong with me ' Philipps joined the dozens of celebrities , athletes and social and business influencers who have made videos for the Child Mind Institute , a nonprofit that helps children and young adults with mental health and learning disorders , to talk about depression and anxiety Among them : Kristen Bell , James Van Der Beek , Brittany Snow , and Clark Gregg .

It feels kind of incredible ' One oft - repeated message among other celebrities in their videos to their younger selves is not to feel embarrassed or ashamed .

Carlo Celli and Nathan Richardson Opinion contributors As soccer 's 2018 World Cup winds down , there is no American mens team in the finals -- or even the tournament .
For all of Americas wealth and population , the U.S. mens team was eliminated by ... Panama .
Adding insult to injury , Panama lost every game they played , including a 6 - 1 thrashing by England .
What happened ?
Why is our men 's soccer team so weak ?
Pundits may place blame at the highest levels -- the president of the U.S. Soccer Federation , or the coach of the national team .
But maybe the problem is not at the top .
Maybe it 's at a local field , where kids practice in fancy uniforms under the eyes of anxious parents , hands - on coaches and vigilant referees .
Kids stand in line kicking balls through cones , listening to lectures about technique and tactics .
They are not playing soccer , they 're practicing it .
But soccer is a game .
To learn the beautiful game , they need to play it .
Teams that win teach their kids differently Around the world , kids play in mixed - age pickup games , un - coached , without parents , uniforms or shin guards .
They play with different - sized balls , not on grass , but on hard , fast , small courts packed with kids , where real skill is required just to control the ball , and the basic skills of the game teach themselves .
The greatest player of all time , the Brazilian legend Pele ( Edson Arantes do Nascimento ) , learned to play soccer barefoot .
The " Shoeless Ones " was the name of his first team .
He had no cleats , cone drills , or heroic soccer parents carpooling to practices , games , and tournaments .
His ball was a sock stuffed with rags .
In some of the countries that eliminated the U.S. from the World Cup , that same lack of equipment and organization at the grassroots results in the sort of creative and fast - paced game that American soccer has not produced .
Are American kids learning to really play ?
Many kids are left behind in a pay - to - play system that excludes huge swathes of America 's youth .
Those who can pay find themselves in ever fancier uniforms , participating in ever - more - tightly organized practices .
Our kids travel for hours , often across state lines , and even across the entire country in search of " outstanding " competition , sometimes spending more time traveling than playing .
What skill are they learning ?
How to sit in the car .
Of course some may obtain a college scholarship , which in men 's soccer might cover the cost of books .
An even tinier sliver may make it to the pro ranks .
But any fan watching our men 's national team in action can recognize that the products of America 's " soccer industrial complex " lack the creativity and skill on the ball to be world - class .
This could be the solution Just maybe , the keys to getting a U.S. mens team to the World Cup and a childs happiness are the same .
Perhaps the quest for perfect equipment , perfect fields and perfect competition in an adult - driven system has prevented our kids from developing the skills , instincts and creativity to master the beautiful game .
To become a soccer - playing nation , we need to rethink how the game is learned and played at the grassroots level , even if it means not playing on grass at all .
Because what we 're doing right now is n't working .
No wonder participation has declined by around 24 % in recent years .
More : Why I 'm deeply into the World Cup : It 's like watching the world at war , with no blood Why ' Brits ' do n't support England at the World Cup Let 's hope Russia does n't end up ruining this amazing World Cup With soccer , less may be more .
In the early years , forget the drills , equipment and travel .
Let the kids play on the speedy blacktops , concrete and hard - packed dirt abundant across the fruited plain .
Let younger kids learn by copying older kids .
The simple supervision of a YMCA , parks and recreation program or local club is all the organization needed .
The same countries where kids first learn a " shoeless " game have carefully controlled systems at higher levels .
But at the grassroots , their kids are playing .
Ours are not .
Their kids are winning .
Ours are not .
The solution is simple .
The cost- and time - savings are staggering .
And the organization and infrastructure already exist .
Let 's strip off the gear , throw out the expensive system and take soccer back to the creativity of the streets .
Like Pele , let 's go " shoeless . "

Caroline Van Zile Opinion contributor As someone who has had the privilege of working for Supreme Court justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh , a few words spring to mind whenever his name is mentioned : Brilliant .
Independent .
Fair minded .
Down to earth .
Boss .
Mentor .
Friend .
In the coming days , commentators will be spinning their own version of who Brett Kavanaugh is , as a jurist and as a person .
Many have never met him .
But I had the pleasure and honor of clerking for the judge .
During that time , I worked with him intensely , helping him research cases and write opinions .
Watching him decide cases taught me volumes about his work ethic and approach to the law .
I 'm a Democrat , and Kavanaugh hired me I should lead with a caveat : The judge and I do not always see eye to eye , particularly when it comes to politics .
I m a registered Democrat .
It might come as a surprise , then , that Judge Kavanaugh would hire me .
But it is just one illustration of what an independent jurist and open - minded person he is .
During my time in the judges chambers , I came to understand what judicial excellence looks like -- and that being an excellent judge means considering views that do not always mirror your own .
From the moment a case arrived in his chambers , Judge Kavanaugh immersed himself in it .
He wanted to understand every argument and perspective : What were the best points in favor of one side ?
How about the other ?
What was the text of the statute ?
And what did the Constitution have to say about the matter ?
The judge was always eager to debate the merits of a case , and he welcomed all perspectives .
That may explain why he routinely hires clerks with diverse ideological views and backgrounds .
When the judge wrote an opinion in a case , he would write , and rewrite , and rewrite .
Again .
And again .
And again .
Every word had to be perfect .
Just as important , the opinion had to be understandable to anyone who cared to read it .
The judge wanted to make the law accessible .
When he wrote an opinion on civil rights , he might reference " To Kill a Mockingbird " or Langston Hughes .
He used common sense and made every effort to connect with his readers , whether they were lawyers or not .
Not just a great judge , but a great man The judge did nt just teach me about legal principles .
I learned a lot about integrity , humility and kindness , too .
Truth be told , my favorite memories of my time with him are nt about cases or the law at all .
I remember , for example , Judge Kavanaugh sharing stories about his mother , whom he deeply admires .
She worked as a teacher , a lawyer and eventually a judge .
His mothers journey taught him volumes about the importance of equality for women in the workplace .
And it made him a great coach for a young attorney like me , who sometimes needed prodding to speak out and stand her ground .
Indeed , in a profession that often feels overwhelmingly male , the judge has been a champion for women .
The vast majority of women who clerked for the judge have gone on to secure prestigious Supreme Court clerkships .
They have also worked in all three branches of government .
Every time I have faced a career decision , the judge has been there for me , willing to write a letter , make a phone call or just talk things through .
He is unfailingly generous with his time .
More : For progressives , there 's a bright side to Brett Kavanaugh 's supreme Court nomination Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will face anti - Catholic bigotry -- yes , bigotry Kavanaugh gets the nod , now comes the spectacle Since I left chambers , Judge Kavanaugh has remained a trusted mentor and a friend .
When my husband and I were planning our wedding , we asked him to officiate .
Marrying my husband was , without a doubt , the most important day of my life .
Having someone with Judge Kavanaughs moral character and integrity officiate made it all the more meaningful .
Judge Kavanaugh has written more than 300 judicial opinions , and his positions in high - profile cases have been adopted by the Supreme Court an astonishing 13 times .
But to his clerks , he is so much more than his credentials -- he is our trusted mentor and a valued friend .
Judge Kavanaugh is incredibly qualified to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court .
Beyond that , he is a good , kind and fair - minded person .
Americans should be proud to have someone with his independence , integrity and character on the bench .
Caroline Van Zile is a former law clerk to Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy .
Caterpillar Inc. 's stock CAT , -0.97 % fell 0.7 % in premarket trade Tuesday , as a bearish " death cross " chart pattern is set to appear .
That would snap a streak of 566 sessions , going back to April 18 , 2016 , in which the 50-day moving average ( MA ) was above the 200-day moving average , the longest such streak in over 4 decades .
The latest streak is the longest since at least January 1972 , which is the earlier available data on FactSet .
The previous longest streak was 524 sessions ending Aug. 19 , 2011 .
When the 50-day MA falls below the 200-day MA -- a death cross -- many chart watchers believe it marks the spot that a shorter - term decline becomes a longer - term downtrend .
On Tuesday , the 50-day MA is on track to open at $ 147.76 and the 200-day MA set to open at $ 147.87 .
Caterpillar 's stock had already entered a bear market on June 25 , when the stock closed 20.1 % below its Jan. 22 record close of $ 170.89 .
The stock has tumbled 9.9 % over the past three months through Monday , while the Dow has gained 1.1 % .

Chances are you re not lugging a heavy , gold brick into a coffee shop to buy your daily cup of joe .
But one financial technology company based in London is making it possible to satisfy your caffeine fix , or purchase countless other goods , by using the yellow metal in digital form .
Glint runs a free - to - download mobile app of the same name .
The app allows users to buy fractions of a physical bar of gold digitally , then use that gold to electronically buy items using an accompanying , multicurrency Mastercard Inc. MA , -2.74 % debit card . "
Were reintroducing gold as money , " said Ben Davies , Glints co - founder and chief operating officer , who , with Glints co - founder and Chief Executive Jason Cozens , demonstrated their marriage of old and new -- gold and tech -- at MarketWatchs London office . "
It was once money , it will be money again and it already is now under this application , " said Davies , whose more than 20 years of working in financial markets includes co - founding investment firm Hinde Capital and running the Hinde Gold Fund , which has a long bias on gold bullion .
Golds allure for use in everyday life is essentially timeless , with historians tracing the use of gold coins as far back as 550 B.C. in what s now modern - day Turkey , according to the World Gold Council .
No coins need to change hands with Glint . "
Lets just do it : I m going to now buy two grams of gold , " said Cozens , demonstrating on his phone . "
Its going to cost me PS61 .
I review that , that s the [ spot ] rate ... confirm it ... done .
Now , I have some more gold , " he said . "
We got a taxi on the way here and I used 0.21 grams of gold to pay for it . "
That cab ride to MarketWatchs office , breakfast at The Ned -- a high - end hot spot nestled near the Bank of England -- a visit to the Bombay Canteen in Mumbai and various places in Tokyo are some of the Glint transactions that Cozens displayed , and purchases of coffee and tea with MarketWatch at a nearby Pret - A - Manger elicited a " Wow ! "
when the gold - based transaction is shown to the cashier . "
I do nt have to worry about whether the pound has dropped against the yen or the rupee or not , " said Cozens . "
I have a certain order that transfers my wage into my Glint account every month and I just spend in gold because I know its going to be inflation - hedged .
If anything happens to the system , its going to be OK , and wherever I fly in the world I do nt have to worry about ' Did I buy enough euros in time ?
Did I get it at a good rate ? "
Affinity for gold Davies , 46 , and Cozens , 48 , are bringing digitized gold to the masses from Glints headquarters in Shoreditch , a London neighborhood known for its hipster ethos and cutting - edge tech firms .
The idea of Glint stretches back eight years and the two started full - time work on it three years ago .
The Glint app will be running in the U.S. by the end of the third quarter of this year after launching in the U.K. and in Europe at the end of 2017 .
As little as 1 British pound , one euro or one U.S. dollar will get someone started on the app .
Glint customers are able to hold euros and U.S. dollars , with gold and sterling in multicurrency wallets , through a single account .
Davies and Cozens are fans of gold as it acts as a traditional hedge against inflation and they consider gold the strongest vehicle for girding against factors that eat into the value of paper currencies , such as massive purchases of sovereign and corporate bonds , or quantitative easing , by global central banks . "
We do nt want to have a dystopian view of what s happening in the world .
The affinity for gold in other parts of the world is a much more cultural phenomena and there are people engaging in movement of physical gold for transactions .
Were tapping into an $ 8 trillion market -- were just digitizing it , " said Davies .
Glints COO Ben Davies with CEO Jason Cozens Glint Glint , which is regulated by the U.K.s Financial Conduct Authority , makes money by charging a fee of 0.5 % when a user purchases gold , and a 0.5 % fee when the user spends or sells their gold .
The average gold balance for Glint customers amounts to 45 grams , worth PS1,382 ( $ 1,831 ) at current spot prices .
Customers can only use gold that s purchased through the app because that ensures chain of integrity .
The authenticity of the gold bars has been audited by KPMG and the gold is 100 % insured for their full replacement value by the famed Lloyd 's of London and Brinks Co. BCO , -1.62 % , whose armored trucks are a familiar sight around banks throughout the U.S. As well , the physical gold is held in secured Brinks vaults in Switzerland that are accredited by the London Bullion Market Association , which sets standards over trading and refining of precious metals world - wide .
Read : How Londons financial technology startups are riding out Brexit Glint has raised more than PS7.5 million from private and institutional investors , and recently tallied PS1.25 million through crowd - funding on Crowdcube , a British investing platform .
Glint is aiming to drum up PS15 million in its first major round of fundraising .
The company , whose investors include the Tokyo Commodity Exchange , has outstripped a target of 15,000 registered customers since December .
The Glint app arrives at a time when countless people world - wide have been enraptured by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin , Litecoin , ether and other so - called altcoins . "
We really are happy about the way that cryptocurrencies have exploded in terms of the interest because it demonstrates the thirst that people have for an independent form of money , " said Cozens . "
That mind - set is growing within the world .
I think it started in the last financial crisis -- certainly it was my journey into this .
Now people are happy to even consider something alternative to government - issued money . "
But " cryptocurrencies are created by people , managed by people ... any kind of money that has a human influence is open to corruption ... gold is created by neutron stars .
You ca nt fake it , you ca nt change it , you ca nt double it , " said Cozens , who founded online gold bullion dealer GoldMadeSimple.com , and has worked for more than 20 years in the e - commerce tech and digital marketing industries . "
Even the price of gold -- we do nt think of gold increasing or decreasing in price .
We just see the paper currencies and the cryptocurrencies that are used to buy it go up and down , " he said .
See : Coinbase to explore the addition of 5 new crypto - coins to its platform Golds popularity also stems from its status as a haven at times of political and financial instability .
But gold , like all markets , has its challenges .
Rising interest rates , for example , can diminish golds appeal because the commodity does nt offer a yield .
Gold prices US : GCQ8 have their strong runs and down times , like other assets .
Dollar - denominated gold futures prices have lost roughly 5 % so far in 2018 .
Gold prices in 2017 surged by more than 13 % on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange , building on a nearly 9 % jump in 2016 .
Gold futures dropped for three years before that , but that was after a 12-year winning streak . "
The key thing is with spending gold is if you are average - cost buying gold through your salary every month for your entire life in any one year and you re spending it , you ve got a storer of wealth , " said Davies . "
You re protected against the corruption of fiat money , i.e. loss of purchasing power , and you re never really exposed to a big drop in the gold price because you re constantly buying in and spending . "
Dollar- or pound - cost averaging is a method of making investments over a scheduled period as a way to brace against and take advantage of falling markets . "
I ve lived that life .
For 12 years -- I run a gold fund -- I have been taking out money in gold , " said Davies . "
I was having to liquidate out of gold to then spend throughout the month .
This [ app ] is better because I can hold the gold and just spend a little bit when I want to .
This is everything we ve wanted . "
Chandler , Arizona , police said they have arrested a former youth baseball coach years after he was first alleged to have molested boys on his teams .
Richard Allen Gallegos , 53 , is facing charges of molestation , sexual conduct and attempted sexual conduct with a minor .
The Phoenix man was arrested Tuesday in connection with the alleged crimes , which were said to have been perpetrated on boys ages 11 to 14 years old .
Gallegos was the subject of a Chandler police investigation in 2009 for his suspected behavior towards children , but detectives did not have enough evidence to charge Gallegos with a crime , according to Sgt .
Daniel Mejia , a spokesman for the Chandler Police Department .
At the time , Gallegos helped coach a club baseball team in Ahwatukee and volunteered as a baseball coach at Seton Catholic Preparatory High School in Chandler until early 2011 , according to Mejia .
It was nt immediately clear if Gallegos has coached since .
A former player on the club team , now 21 years old , contacted Chandler police in June and alleged multiple sexual encounters with Gallegos when he was between 11 and 14 years old , police wrote in court records .
Mejia said another former player also came forward and revealed sexual encounters with Gallegos .
Both players were interviewed between 2010 and 2011 but did not disclose any sexual activity with Gallegos , according to court records .
On July 10 , one of the accusers made a police - monitored phone call to Gallegos , in which Gallegos spoke about touching him on multiple occasions , court records said .
After Gallegos was arrested , he admitted to being the man on the other end of the recorded conversation , but he denied any inappropriate touching . "
Our Catholic Schools Office and Seton Catholic Preparatory are cooperating with the police investigation as we seek to learn more about this situation , " Robert DeFrancesco , a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix , said in a statement Wednesday . "
Chandler police do not have any reason to believe that the crimes were committed at the school .
Anyone who has been a victim of abuse or who may have information concerning these allegations is encouraged to call the Chandler Police Department . "
Investigators are still determining if Gallegos continued to coach baseball or interact with children as a coach or instructor after 2011 , Mejia said .
Gallegos was booked into a Maricopa County jail on suspicion of three counts of molestation of a child , five counts of sexual conduct of a minor and two counts of attempted sexual conduct with a minor , Mejia said .

Charles Curtis and Steven Ruiz NFL training camps are on the not - so - distant horizon , which means fantasy football is just around the corner .
Our fantasy nuts Steven Ruiz and Charles Curtis are already knee - deep in analysis for the 2018 season even though it 's too early .
So throughout July , they 'll be sharing their early thoughts , starting with their sleepers they 're already buzzing about .
1 .
Mitchell Trubisky , QB Bears Steven : This might be a hard sell for fantasy players , but I 'm gon na ask you to ignore Trubisky 's numbers in 2017 .
John Fox and his outdated offensive philosophy is gone .
The Bears ' receiving corps has been completely overhauled .
And Trubisky 's may have produced the best tape of any of last year 's rookie quarterbacks .
He 's a quick decision - maker who knows how to work the pocket and find open receivers .
He just did n't have very many to throw to last season .
That 's going to change in 2018 in Matt Nagy 's offense .
Do n't be surprised when Trubisky is a Top 10 fantasy quarterback by year 's end .
Second opinion : I 'm with Steven here - The Bears ' offense overall will be fantasy gold and The Artist Formerly Known as Mitch has the makings of a breakout .
I also love Tarik Cohen in Year 2 , Allen Robinson to bounce back and the tight end who will catch a bunch of passes from Trubisky ( see below ) . -
Charles 2 .
Amari Cooper , WR Raiders Charles : I was firmly in the " hang on to him through his awful 2017 " camp and suffered with fellow fantasy owners .
But let 's remember a few things : 1 .
He caught 7 touchdowns last year .
2 .
He caught 83 passes two years ago .
3 .
He just turned 24 .
4 .
He 's the only starting wideout who 's caught passes from Derek Carr .
5 .
He was n't struggling to get open last year .
I 've seen him ranked all over the place in the preseason but if you ended up with Cooper as your WR2 or even a Flex , you 'll be happy with the returns .
Second opinion : I 'll add to Charles ' defense of Cooper : He was playing on an injured foot throughout the 2017 season .
If he 's healthy , Cooper will be a top - end WR2 and borderline WR1 now that Michael Crabtree is n't here to hog all of Oakland 's red - zone targets . -
Steven ( AP Photo / Wilfredo Lee ) 3 .
Albert Wilson , WR Dolphins Steven : Wilson will have to fight for targets , but I think he is the most talented receiver on that roster right now .
And that includes Danny Amendola .
He 's got good top - end speed , knows how to get open and was one of the NFL 's best at turning short passes into long gains .
With the underrated Ryan Tannehill coming back , the Dolphins passing game will be a lot more fantasy - friendly .
Second opinion : I 'm admittedly intrigued to see what he can do away from Kansas City and how he 'll replace Jarvis Landry .
But I 'm still - still ! -
on the DeVante Parker bandwagon , Kenny Stills is a presence and Danny Amendola signed .
Too many mouths to feed ? -
Charles Brace Hemmelgarn - USA TODAY Sports 4 .
Rex Burkhead , RB Patriots Charles : As of publishing , Burkhead is 81st overall and RB32 per FantasyPros ' consensus rankings .
That seems too low !
Yes , the Pats drafted Sony Michel ( a highly - drafted rookie but a rookie nonetheless ) and still have James White , Jeremy Hill and Mike Gillislee on the roster .
But Burkhead is the kind of Swiss Army knife that Bill Belichick loves .
He splits out wide , he takes carries at the goalline and does n't fumble much .
Dion Lewis is gone , and although Michel is probably his direct replacement , do n't forget about how Burkhead played with Lewis around in 2017 - six games with three or more catches , eight total touchdowns and over four yards a carry .
Second opinion : I 'm sorry .
I just ca n't get excited for a New England running back .
I would n't be surprised if Burkhead 's overall numbers look good by the end of the season , but he 'll undoubtedly be a frustrating player that you inevitably leave on your bench whenever he has a big game and start when he lays an egg . -

D'Onta Foreman , RB Texans Steven : Foreman did n't got a lot of opportunities during his rookie season , which was cut short by an Achilles injury , but when he did get the ball , he looked like a fantasy stud in the making .
While the injury is certainly a concern , Foreman is still young and should be able to make full recovery .
His combination of speed , power and agility will earn him the top spot on the Texans depth chart by the end of training camp .
With this likely being Lamar Miller 's final season in Houston , the torch will be passed to the former Texas Longhorn .
Second opinion : Lamar Miller is donezo in Houston .
I 'm all in here with Foreman as well even after an Achilles injury . -
Charles 6 .
Corey Davis , WR Titans Charles : I know : It 's obvious to pick a top-5 pick a year ago and think he 'll break out in his sophomore season after an injury held him back .
So why is he ranked so low - 74th and WR31 - then ?
There 's no more " exotic smashmouth " in Tennessee and although Delanie Walker and Rishard Matthews are still with the Titans , this offense 's most explosive weapon might be this guy .
Second opinion : I expect the Titans offense to get a Rams - like boost from the coaching change , and Davis will be one of the biggest beneficiaries .
He flashed plenty of talent during his rookie season and will show us why he was drafted so high a year ago .
I 'm expecting a 80/1,100/7 season out of the second - year player . -
Steven 7 .
Josh Doctson , WR Redskins Steven : A couple facts you probably did n't know : Doctson quietly scored six touchdowns on just 78 targets a season ago .
And did this while catching passes from one of the worst red - zone quarterbacks in the league , per Pro Football Focus ... That 's not ideal for a red zone target .
Sure , Alex Smith is n't known as a guy who is going to boost the fantasy profile of outside receivers , but he was a far more aggressive quarterback a season ago , and there 's no reason to expect him to revert back to his conservative ways .
The Smith - for - Kirk Cousins swap , along with Doctson finally being healthy during the offseason , should lead to a big year for the 2016 first - round pick .
Second opinion : Drafting any WR on Washington is a crapshoot now that Smith is under center .
My instincts initially tell me that Jamison Crowder will get first crack at all that underneath stuff that Smith will throw ... but then I remembered how Smith looked last year in Kansas City .
Doctson might be the beneficiary of of Smith 's downfield looks . -
Charles Robert Hanashiro - USA TODAY Sports 8 .
Trey Burton , TE Bears Charles : See Trubisky , Mitchell .
I 'm all about drafting tight end farther down the line in a draft in the hopes of a breakout , and this guy fits the bill : The 6-foot-3 , 235-pound Burton somehow caught 5 touchdowns last year while stuck behind Zach Ertz and Brent Celek in Philadelphia .
Now , he 'll be a big target for Trubisky in a much - improved offense .
I 'm a buyer .
Second opinion : I ca n't disagree with anything Charles wrote here .
Burton is ready for a breakout year and has the QB and coach to help have that season . -

Torrey Smith , WR Panthers Steven : Smith is ready to fill the void in Carolina 's offense left by Ted Ginn 's departure .
The two have a similar skill - set , and that skill - set has meshed well with Cam Newton 's game in the past .
It was just two years ago that Newton and Ginn connected for 10 touchdown passes on just 97 targets .
If Smith is a major part of the Panthers ' offensive plans , he could have a similar year .
That 's not bad for a receiver you can probably pick up with your last draft pick .
Second opinion : Beyond Greg Olsen , I do n't trust anyone in Carolina 's wide receiver corps .
So , sure : Take a flier on the deep threat and hope that Newton flings him the rock downfield a lot . -
Charles 10 .
Duke Johnson , RB Browns Charles : Talent wins out , right ?
That 's the case with Johnson , who was targeted 93 times ( ! ! ! )
in 2017 , mostly by DeShone Kizer .
Now , he 's got Carlos Hyde and Nick Chubb around , which could mean a nosedive in usage .
I do n't think that 's what will happen , though .
Chubb and Hyde may be in a fight for the first two downs , but Johnson owns that third down , and he 'll catch passes from a QB - Tyrod Taylor - who throws a lot of short stuff ( that 's one reason why Jarvis Landry is a Brown now ) .
PPR leaguers , you wo n't be sorry with the value here .
Second opinion : I know it 's fun to rag on Todd Haley , but he knows how to get the most out of dynamic backs who can catch the football , as evidenced by his work with Le'Veon Bell in Pittsburgh .
I wrote about how the Browns might use Johnson in 2018 after inking him to an extension this offseason . -

Jay Cutler proves he 's exactly who we thought he was on new reality TV show
Charles Curtis and Steven Ruiz NFL training camps are on the not - so - distant horizon , which means fantasy football is just around the corner .
Our fantasy nuts Steven Ruiz and Charles Curtis are already knee - deep in analysis for the 2018 season even though it 's too early .
So throughout July , they 'll be sharing their early thoughts .
They started with sleepers , now it 's potential busts .
1 .
DeShaun Watson , QB Texans Steven : I 'm down on Watson for several reasons : ( 1 ) His 2017 tape was way too erratic , ( 2 ) a lot of his production came on downfield throws to covered receivers , which will be hard to replicate consistently and ( 3 ) we do n't know how healthy he 'll be in 2018 .
I 'd pass on the Texans quarterback this year .
Let him go out and prove last year was n't a fluke before making him your QB1 .
Second opinion : I get it .
I 'm not one to draft quarterbacks high ( see below ) , and I get the feeling he 'll be taken earlier than his ADP .
I 'll wait and roll the dice on some of the later QBs and hope to unearth a sleeper with my backup . -
Charles 2 .
Le'Veon Bell , RB Steelers Charles : It 's not a question of talent .
It 's the fact that he carried the ball 321 times last year AND caught 85 balls .
That 'd be great if those were his numbers this season .
But we 're now in Year 6 with Bell and that 's a ton of usage .
Will the wheels fall off ?
It 's a risk with any highly rated RB , but I 'm not willing to spend a top-3 pick to find out .
Second opinion : I share the same concern .
He 's touched the ball a lot over his five - year career , and his unorthodox running style requires burst that his legs will eventually lose if his workload does n't get cut .
This could be the year all those touches catch up to him . -
Steven ( AP Photo / Jim Mone ) 3 .
Dalvin Cook , RB Vikings Steven : Cook was fantastic as a rookie , but you have to be concerned about a guy who already did n't have great athleticism tearing up his knee .
Hopefully I 'm wrong and Cook looks like the player he did early in 2017 , but I would n't risk a first - round pick on that being the case .
Second opinion : It 's not just the injury , which is a concern .
It 's also the presence of Latavius Murray , who took a bunch of carries away from Jerick McKinnon .
If Cook was 100 % healthy , there would be less of a timeshare .
But he 's not . -
Charles 4 .
Christian McCaffrey , RB Panthers Charles : Remember how aggravated you were that Jonathan Stewart was on the field a lot , taking away touches from this scintillating rookie who - in spite of Stewart 's presence - caught 80 balls last year ?
Well , now you 'll have to deal with C.J. Anderson coming in from the Denver Broncos .
McCaffrey 's skill set is n't in doubt .
But at 26th overall , per Fantasy Pros ?
I 'd rather take a surer thing .
Second opinion : I 'm going to disagree with Charles here .
McCaffrey proved when he was put in the right position he was capable of being a fantasy star .
I have to imagine trading Mike Shula for Norv Turner as offensive coordinator will give McCaffrey , and the Panthers offense as a whole , a significant boost .
Plus Carolina now has a receiving corps defenses have to respect .
That was n't the case a year ago . -
Steven 5 .
Julio Jones , WR Falcons Steven : This really has nothing to do with Jones , and everything to do with Steve Sarkisian being the offensive coordinator in Atlanta .
I just do n't think he has the creativity to get the most out of Jones in the red zone , where the star receiver has n't been much of a threat throughout his career as it is .
And you have to imagine Calvin Ridley 's presence could cut into his targets .
Second opinion : I ca n't decide if Jones ' 2017 red zone numbers were a red zone regression or just a reminder that he 's more valuable between the 20s .
It 's probably the latter ... but is that so bad when he 's got the potential for an explosive game every time he steps on to the field ?
I 'm not sure I agree with Steven here . -
Charles 6 .
Leonard Fournette , RB Jaguars Charles : He 'll be a fringe first - rounder .
But his quarterback is still Blake Bortles and he averaged under 4 yards per carry last year .
Although he 's lost a little weight to speed him up a little , there 's nothing he can do about who 's under center .
And for someone who 's supposed to be a sure thing on a fantasy team , he 's going to face a lot of defenders in the box this year .
Second opinion : While I would n't be happy if I ended up with Fournette as my top pick , I 'm not as down on him as Charles is .
He 'll be a better player in Year 2 and he 'll also get to run behind an All - Pro left guard in free agent acquisition Andrew Norwell . -
Steven 7 .
Adam Thielen , WR Vikings Steven : Thielen is one of the better deep threats in the league , and in order for him to reach his fantasy ceiling he 'll need to get good service on those deep routes .
I 'm not sure Kirk Cousins is capable of providing that significantly .
Cousins is better in the short and intermediate game , where Stefon Diggs ' run - after - catch ability will make him the favorite target in Minnesota .
Second opinion : You know what 's going to happen , right ?
You 're going to debate for weeks about Thielen vs. Stefon Diggs .
And whoever you choose to be Cousins ' favorite option will turn out to be the opposite .
That 's life .
But I 'm more on the Thielen bandwagon simply because he 'll have more receptions .
And more receptions means more opportunities . -
Charles 8 .
Mike Evans , WR Buccaneers Charles : I 'll admit : If he was WR13 or 14 , I 'd feel a lot better .
But at WR9 - per FantasyPros - I just ca n't .
Last year , he was targeted 136 times , caught 71 balls and barely got over the 1,000-yard mark .
He 'll have Ryan Fitzpatrick throwing him the ball to start the season , but the stat I ca n't get away from is this : He had one - one ! -
100-yard game in 2017 .
Fantasy kryptonite for me .
Second opinion : I see what Charles is saying , but as long as Jameis Winston remains healthy after serving his three - game suspension , I 'm expecting big things for Evans in 2018 .
He 's been paid and his quarterback is primed to take the next step in his development after a sneaky good 2017 season . -
Steven 9 .
Tyreek Hill , WR Chiefs Steven : Sammy Watkins is the better all - around player and one of the more dangerous deep threats when healthy .
I could see him cutting into to those deep targets Hill thrived on in 2017 .
And I could also see Andy Reid dialing back on the pass attempts with a green QB behind center , making Hill more of a boom - or - bust player than he already was in 2017 .
Second opinion : Could n't agree more .
Watkins will turn Hill into the role that will keep him healthier - a big play threat .
His usage will drop , and even if he turns into a threat to score a touchdown on a few touches a game , the risk for him to be bust in some weeks looms . -
Charles 10 .
Any of the top-5 quarterbacks Charles : I have no doubt Aaron Rodgers , Tom Brady and the rest will be great .
But I also have no doubt that the 2018 versions of Carson Wentz , Jared Goff , and Deshaun Watson will emerge from the backups drafted in your league .
Second opinion : No arguments here .
You can get some ultra - productive quarterbacks outside of the top-5 .
You can wait for guys like Matt Stafford , Cam Newton and Philip Rivers and get 95 % of the production you get from the elite names . -

Chris Nelsen Special to the Detroit Free Press Jalen Watts - Jackson has no regrets about his football career at Michigan State .
The former Spartans defensive back -- best remembered for his 38-yard winning touchdown off a botched Michigan punt attempt in 2015 that lifted MSU to a 27 - 23 victory -- plans to forego his final season of eligibility and join the Air Force . "

Walking away from football was n't easy , but it 's something I 'm going to stick with .

Christian Whiton Opinion contributor Defenders of NATO are fond of calling it " the most successful alliance in history . "
That s a great talking point and NATO did witness the collapse of its chief opponent , the Soviet Union , without ever going to war .
But that occurred 27 years ago .
Since then , NATOs contribution to our national security is much less apparent .
NATO was founded in 1949 when Europe was still destitute from World War II , and the Soviet Union looked poised to invade .
Today , Europe has a high - tech economy of about $ 17 trillion , more than 10 times the size of Russias .
Clearly Europe has the means to take primary responsibility for its own defense .
Meanwhile , we need to focus on deterring an increasingly capable and dangerous China as well as managing other threats like Iran and North Korea .
But some European leaders do nt see it that way .
In response to criticism by President Donald Trump about defense spending and trade , the president of the European Council , Donald Tusk , said : " Dear America , appreciate your allies , after all you do nt have that many . "
What this ingratitude shows is that Europes political class takes American taxpayers for granted .
They want to spend their money on infrastructure and luxurious social systems while Americans make sacrifices for their defense .
If Europeans see serious threats , they should make sacrifices too .
Would we ask Europe to pay for the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border ?
Successive American presidents have complained that the current arrangement is nt fair , and NATO members have long pledged to spend more on their defense .
They will do so again today , but they never seriously deliver .
Its time to restructure NATO fundamentally .
America should remain a partner , but we should move most of our forces home , or to the Pacific to deter China .
Europe should take primary responsibility for its own defense .

Cliff Kenney , a 35-year - old living in New Jersey , joined the waiting list for Robinhoods cryptocurrency trading platform in January .
Robinhood let customers know gradually via email when cryptocurrency was allowed to be traded through Robinhood in their state , and New Jersey legalized it this month .
In the meantime , he shared his referral link on Twitter TWTR , -2.55 % and hoped friends would sign up .
More customers might have a similar experience soon , as companies are capitalizing on " FOMO , " or a fear of missing out . "
I think its smart , " Kenney said . "
It reminds you there s something you re waiting for .
There are plenty of waiting lists you can sign up for , like season tickets for a team or concert tickets , and it creates a little bit of anticipation for it , too . "
More than 1 million people waited to get access to a cryptocurrency trading platform on Robinhood . (
The company did not respond to MarketWatchs request for comment . )
And over 100,000 people have signed up in the last year for the waiting list for Petal , a no - fee credit card that has not yet launched , the company said .
SoFi Money , a bank account through the lender SoFi , would not disclose an official number on its waiting list , but said it was " multiple tens of thousands . "
Why 92 % of Americans mistrust their own financial institution Most people have heard of waiting in line for an exclusive sneaker or Apples AAPL , -0.32 % latest iPhone , but for a debit card ?
The pre - ordering list for Acorns Spend opened June 5 , and there are already 175,000 customers lined up for the account and debit card , which will be available Nov. 1 , according to the companys CEO , Noah Kerner .
More than 350,000 joined a waiting list for Acorns Later in the months leading up to its April 2018 launch .
Some observers see the lists as gimmicks to drum up business , while others claim they re necessary because of genuine demand for a certain product .
The virtual equivalent of a crowd outside a nightclub or Harry Potter on Broadway , the waiting lists come as some parts of the once - wide - open internet are becoming more exclusive .
Wait lists can make customers feel like they re getting a reward .
Jeremy Wright , a 31-year - old in Boise , Idaho , said its " fulfilling " to wait for a service or product .
He signed up for waiting lists for Robinhood , the peer - to - peer payment service CashApp and SoFi Money .
Wright works for U.S. Bank USB , -0.89 % and said he likes to try out new forms of digital banking . "
It makes you feel popular , albeit in a very faux , social - media - bubble kind of way , " he said .
That feeling of exclusivity is good for brands , especially when apps are clamoring for users .
Some famous Instagrammers are putting their accounts on private , and celebrities and other beautiful people can now pay for their own private dating site .
Cliff Kenney said sometimes a waiting list can be gratifying .
Courtesy of Cliff Kenney Why do companies make you wait for their product ?
Acorns said the companys new debit cards are made from tungsten metal , which is relatively costly , and wanted to start with making just 100,000 while gauging customers interest , Kerner said .
The pre - order list was " not a gimmick , " he added . "
Once we saw how quickly people pre - ordered them , we started working on another round . "
Many people want what they ca nt have , said Oliwia Berdak , a principal analyst of digital business strategy at research firm Forrester .
And creating a waiting list is one way to drum up interest . "
It makes it seem like you re part of a very exclusive club if you join one of these accounts , " she said .
Some companies acknowledge that waiting lists create a buzz .
SoFi started a waiting list for its checking account , SoFi Money , in January 2018 because " the exclusivity of a waitlist contributes to the appeal , " said Tony Morosini , vice president of banking at SoFi .
The company began taking people off the waitlist in June , and the accounts will be publicly available later this year .
Financial technology companies also need to establish trust before they roll out their products .
SoFi Money wanted to make sure the account was working correctly , Morosini said . "
By controlling how many people are on the product at a given time , we have the capacity to ensure an overall positive user experience , with room to quickly and efficiently fix bugs as they re found , " he said .
What if the product never comes out ?
Robinhood , SoFi Money and Acorns did nt ask for any money up front , but consumers should be cautious about companies that do , Berdak said .
Sometimes startup companies attempt to fundraise on crowdsourcing platforms , but they do nt reach their goal and ca nt proceed . "
If the product does nt get manufactured , you lose your money and there s nothing you can do , " she said .

College debt is building and , increasingly , parents are on the hook .
Where do you turn when you 've maxed out on federal student loans ?
Ask Mom and Dad to take out some parent loans , too .
The average cumulative federal student loan debt that parents borrow even exceeds what 's being taken on by students , according to new research .
On average , parents owed $ 32,596 for their cumulative loans taken out under the Federal Parent PLUS program at college graduation in 2015 - 16 .
On average , college grads with bachelor 's degrees owed $ 29,669 in student loans in 2015 - 16 , according to Mark Kantrowitz , publisher and vice president of research for Savingforcollege.com .
To be sure , a much smaller percentage of parents borrow than students .
About 69 percent of students took out student loans in 2015 - 16 , compared with about 14.4 percent of parents , Kantrowitz said .
The high cost of college -- and the inability of some families to save much money -- has caused nearly half of college grads with student loans to take out the maximum amount of loans allowed under the federal student loan program . "
The parents are picking up the overflow when the student reaches the student loan limits , " Kantrowitz said .
In many cases , the student could even agree to repay the Parent PLUS loans . "
Some parents will have side agreements with the student where the student agrees to make the payments , " Kantrowitz said .
More : As financial burden rises , college students question value of education More : Piggybacking on good credit : Things to consider before co - signing a student loan More : Student loan debt : 7 steps to pay it off Need to borrow is even greater Not everyone who borrows , of course , is borrowing to the max .
One Dearborn , Michigan , mother I talked with took out about $ 6,000 in loans about five years ago when her daughter began attending Central Michigan University .
The idea was to borrow some for the first year to pay part of the tuition , try to pay that off quickly and then build up savings to cover the cost of college in future years .
Her daughter worked during the summers , took a few odd jobs while she was at school in Mt. Pleasant , Michigan , and she took out about $ 5,000 in student loans herself .
The mother repaid the loans ; the daughter who graduated in 2017 still has a bit more to go .
For students who attend higher cost private colleges and out - of - state schools , the need to borrow can become even greater . "
They have to get the money from somewhere , " Kantrowitz said . "
Debt may be the only option , especially if you 're going to a more expensive college . "
Parents take on more student loan debt for a variety of reasons .
Some college students are attending some expensive , prestigious schools to study specific fields .
Some parents saved far less than they needed for college , financial aid is n't as easy to get as some families expect , and big scholarships are limited .
When student borrowing hits the limit , more parents start filling out the paperwork for private student loans or the federal Parent PLUS loans .
Parent borrowing on PLUS loans is up 19.2 percent from $ 27,352 in 2011 - 12 .
And it 's up 40 percent from $ 23,279 nearly 10 years ago , according to research by Kantrowitz .
Kantrowitz , who reviewed recently released federal government data , was a bit surprised to see student loan borrowing for undergrads basically flatline from around 2011 to 2016 .
But it was less surprising when he realized that students were maxing out on the limits . "
Parent Plus borrowing is in some ways a pressure release valve , " Kantrowitz said .
Average cumulative debt at graduation for bachelor 's degree recipients increased by only 1 percent from 2011 to 2016 .
But that 's up 26.5 percent from $ 23,228 in 2007 - 08 .
Here are points to consider for parents looking at a Parent PLUS loan : How much can I borrow ?
The maximum limit for a Parent PLUS loan is the cost of attendance ( determined by the school ) minus any other financial aid received .
So the PLUS loans can fill the gap for many costly schools if there is no other savings or parents are n't able to cover some costs out of their current income .
The maximum that a dependent student can take out for a federal Stafford loan is $ 5,500 for a freshman with the amount going up to $ 6,500 in the second year and $ 7,500 in the third year and beyond .
The aggregate loan limit for students for Federal Direct Stafford Loans is $ 31,000 for dependent students .
But to hit that maximum , students would need to borrow for a fifth year .
The limits are higher for independent students , which include students age 24 and older , veterans and students attending graduate and professional schools .

Here are some strategies What 's the rate ?
Parents who borrow to help out their college - age children can expect to pay 7.6 percent , up from 7 percent , for the federal parent PLUS loans .
The same rate applies to the Federal Grad PLUS loans .
These are fixed rates for the life of the loan .
The new rates will apply to new federal loans made beginning July 1 through June 30 , 2019 .
The family should maximize the Federal Stafford loan borrowing before the PLUS loan because the Stafford loan has a lower interest rate , Kantrowitz said .
As of July 1 , the fixed interest rate on federal student loans increased to 5.045 percent , up from 4.45 percent for undergraduate Stafford loans .
The rate goes up to 6.595 percent , up from 6 percent for Stafford loans for graduate school .
What if you have a great credit history ?
Some lenders may offer a more competitive rate on private student loans offered to parents who have a credit score of 780 or higher , Kantrowitz said .
College students might get offers for private student loans sent directly to them , but the odds of a student being approved for a private loan on his or her own are slim .
Most students need a cosigner .
A private student loan might have an effective rate that 's 1.5 percent lower than a Parent PLUS loan for top - flight borrowers .
That 's because a loan fee of around 4.25 percent is charged and deducted from the PLUS loan amount when it is first disbursed .
Over a 10-year loan , the fee would translate into an extra 1 percentage point on the rate , Kantrowitz said .
You need to shop around for rates , and keep in mind your credit score .
Remember , rates on private student loans are wide - ranging , again , depending on creditworthiness .
For example , PNCs undergraduate Solution Loan offers two options .
There 's a variable rate , which ranges from 5.23 percent to 11.23 percent and a fixed rate from 6.29 percent to 12.29 percent .
Attractive rates at the low end go to borrowers with the best credit history .
There is no application or origination fee and a 0.5 percent discount is offered with automated payments from any savings or checking account .
Is a home equity loan a better deal ?
To be sure , the federal PLUS loans are n't the only ways that parents can borrow money for college .
Many parents have used a home equity line of credit to deal with college bills .
Home equity lines of credit have variable rates and can run in the 5 percent to 7 percent range -- reflecting a prime rate at 5 percent .
Rates lower than that tend to be introductory rates in effect for a limited period of time .
Better rates are available for those with credit scores above 740 and homeowners who have lower loan balances on their homes .
But as the Federal Reserve continues to push up interest rates , the prime rate will go up , and rates on home equity loans will adjust higher , too .
In the past , the housing crisis shut down some borrowing on home equity loans as home values fell in much of the country .
Lenders looked harder at credit histories and property appraisals .
But now , many home values have risen considerably .
Yet there is another point to consider : The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ended some income tax deductions for home equity lines of credit .
Interest on home equity loans will no longer be deductible beginning in 2018 , if the loan was used on things like paying for college tuition , taking a vacation or buying a new car .
The interest on that home equity loan would still be deductible if the money goes toward building , acquiring or substantially improving the home .
If parents do n't get a tax break any longer , tapping into home equity would become a less attractive way to pay for college . "
Between rising interest rates and the loss of tax deductibility , home equity lines are nt the low cost source of capital they had been , " said Greg McBride , chief financial analyst for Bankrate.com .
Even so , rising home prices are increasing , and parents could borrow against the house or refinance to take cash out of the home , too . "
Would - be borrowers often look at home equity as ' found money when access to cash is needed , " McBride said .
Does every parent qualify ?
The good news is a parent can get the federal PLUS loan even with a lower credit score .
But you need to expect a credit check .
A PLUS loan will be rejected if a parent has an adverse credit history .
Under the regulations , someone could be denied a Parent PLUS loan if he or she has a current delinquency of 90 or more days on total outstanding balances of greater than $ 2,085 .
Other adverse events include a bankruptcy discharge , wage garnishment , tax lien or foreclosure during the five previous years .
There are various ways to still apply , such as getting someone other than the student to agree to repay the loan if the borrower does not repay it .
And there are ways to appeal regarding extenuating circumstances .
Another thought : If a parent is denied , a dependent undergrad would become eligible for higher Stafford loan limits .
More students are taking advantage of the extra limits , according to Kantrowitz .
About 7.4 percent of students benefited from the higher limits after their parents were denied PLUS loans in 2015 - 16 .
That 's up from 5.8 percent in 2011 - 12 and 3.3 percent in 2007 - 08 .

College football is almost here .
USA TODAY Sports is getting you ready for the 2018 season by breaking down the best players at each position in the Football Bowl Subdivision .
Next up : the wide receivers .
There s no clear , cant - miss headliner at the position heading into the regular season .
But with as many as 15 or 20 battling for recognition , it should be an intense competition for national hardware and postseason All - America honors .
From the Atlantic Coast Conference to the Pac-12 Conference and all points in between , here are the best wide receivers in college football for 2018 .
1 .
A.J. Brown , Mississippi You had some idea that Brown was set for a fine career with the Rebels after his solid freshman season in 2016 .
Then he took things to another level : Brown caught 75 balls and scored 11 touchdowns as a sophomore to cement his place as the top receiver in the Southeastern Conference and the entire FBS .
The NFL is waiting .
MORE : Oklahoma remains the team to beat in the Big 12 MORE : Ten college football coaches on the hot seat entering this season MORE : The best running backs in college football for 2018 2 .
NKeal Harry , Arizona State There might not be a more physically gifted receiver in college football , with all due respect to Brown and the other names on this list .
Once a top - tier recruit , Harry lived up expectations in making 82 grabs for 1,142 yards as a sophomore in 2017 .
His connection with ASU quarterback Manny Wilkins assures that Harry will rank among the most productive Power Five receivers in the country .
3 .
David Sills , West Virginia Sills averaged about a touchdown grab for every three receptions in 2017 , which is as good a number as any to describe his winding road from cant - miss quarterback prospect to preseason All - America lock .
At a sturdy 6 - 4 and more than 200 pounds , Sills has the size and body control to own the red zone and pick on smaller defensive backs .
The best part ?
You can make the case that due to his relative inexperience , Sills best is yet to come .
4 .
Kelvin Harmon , North Carolina State Harmon and quarterback Ryan Finley form one of the top offensive combinations in the FBS .
Harmon has nt gained the same level of publicity as his quarterback , but that should change in 2018 .
His size , toughness and strength puts Harmon in an elite class of receiver -- and makes him a threat to fall in the first round of next years NFL draft .
5 .
Anthony Johnson , Buffalo The first of two Group of Five receivers on this list , Johnson led all returning FBS pass - catchers in receiving touchdowns ( 14 ) , receiving yards per game ( 113 ) and overall receiving yards ( 1,356 ) .
The former junior - college transfer simply brings too much to the table for Mid - American Conference defenses to handle .
Buffalos early matchups with Temple , Rutgers and Army will give Johnson three chances to prove himself during non - conference play .
6 .
Marquise Brown , Oklahoma On a national level , Browns first year at Oklahoma went largely unnoticed amid Baker Mayfields Heisman Trophy , tight end Jake Andrews All - America production and running back Rodney Andersons torrid second half to the regular season .
But the JUCO transfer was a revelation : Brown led Oklahoma in receiving yards ( 1,095 ) and yards per catch ( 19.21 ) while saving some of his best performances for the Sooners biggest games -- such as Oklahoma State , the Big 12 championship game and the Rose Bowl .
7 .
Stanley Morgan Jr. , Nebraska Morgan exemplifies Nebraskas offensive outlook in Scott Frosts first season : inexperience at quarterback , unproven speed at running back , a very questionable front and talent to burn at receiver .
Morgans the best of the bunch for a solid group that provides some optimism heading into Frosts debut .
If healthy , Morgan will break his school record for receiving yards in a season , become the first Cornhusker to crack 1,000 yards and challenge for All - America accolades .
8 .
Deebo Samuel , South Carolina If he s back to full strength after missing all but the first few weeks of last season , Samuel will give South Carolina the sort of game - breaking , big - play threat it needs to give Georgia a run for the SEC East Division .
Already one of the nations most electric returners , Samuel showed through three games in 2017 that he s more than capable of shouldering the load as the Gamecocks top receiving option .
9 .
Penny Hart , Georgia State Few know about Hart , who plays in relative obscurity for Georgia State in the Sun Belt Conference , but his numbers are ca nt be ignored .
Hart leads all active FBS players in career receiving yards ( 2,281 ) , receiving yards per game ( 84.5 ) and receiving scores ( 17 ) .
The SBC Freshman of the Year in 2015 , Hart missed all but two halves of 2016 but returned to lead the conference in receptions and touchdowns a year ago .
10 .
Jonathan Giles , LSU A name you should know : Giles was a stud for Texas Tech in 2016 , when he made 69 catches for 1,158 yards , before opting to transfer to LSU .
After sitting out last season , Giles has ascended to the top of pecking order for the Tigers , with the hope that his rapport with Ohio State graduate transfer Joe Burrow adds a slice of explosiveness to LSUs often predictable offense .
FIVE JUST OFF THE LIST Jaylen Smith , Louisville Ahmmon Richards , Miami ( Fla. ) Collin Johnson , Texas Cody Thompson , Toledo Juwan Johnson , Penn State

COLUMBUS -- President Donald Trump 's pick for the Supreme Court is being hailed as a conservative voice for the bench , but he once donated to an Ohio Democrat .
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , 53 , donated $ 250 to now - gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray 's unsuccessful bid for state attorney general in 1998 and $ 1,000 to Cordray 's failed bid for the Senate in 2000 .
Cordray lost the Democratic primary for the Senate to former Gov. Dick Celeste 's brother , Ted .
Ted then lost to Republican Mike DeWine , whom Cordray is challenging for governor in November .
Cordray and Kavanaugh both worked at the law firm , Kirkland & Ellis , in Washington , D.C. Both also clerked for retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy , though not at the same time .

In a footnote to that decision , however , Kavanaugh called Cordray " a man of substantial accomplishment and of longstanding and dedicated devotion to public service and the public good . "
That did n't stop Cordray from criticizing Trump 's pick Monday night . "
President Trumps decision today underscores the critical need for Ohioans to have a key backstop in place for them - a governor who will stand on their side and fight back against attempts to undermine our rights , " Cordray said in a statement .

Community is at the heart of Slim & Huskys Pizza Beeria , a Nashville eatery founded by three friends dedicated to giving back to underserved neighborhoods .
Tennessee State University grads Clinton Gray , Derrick Moore and Emanuel Reed struck a chord with Nashville diners when in 2017 they opened their first casual pizza restaurant in a historically black North Nashville neighborhood that s largely been left out of the citys dining boom .
From the early days of operating their Buchanan Street location , the ' 90s hip hop and R&B - themed Slim & Huskys drew long lines at all hours of the day for delicious pizza pies with names like " Nothin But A ' V Thang " for a vegan - friendly special and " The Smokin Herb , " for one loaded with spinach and mushrooms .
Local brews and canned wine round out the menu , More : After nearly 35 years , HED Cycling continues to spin out innovation and growth More : Hometown Trolley business helped single mom keep life on track It is the trios mission to keep their restaurant approachable for neighborhood residents and to employ people who live within walking distance that has earned the pizza restaurant national acclaim . "
We just understand there are not a lot of opportunities in this community for jobs and there are not a lot of opportunities for young children and teenagers to see people that look like them succeeding in business .
We wanted to bring that here , " Derrick Moore said last year prior to the opening of the first Slim & Huskys .
On the heels of that success , Slim & Huskys opened a carry - out outpost with a cinnamon roll menu , aptly named The Rollout .
Another Slim & Huskys debuted in June in Nashville 's Antioch neighborhood .
The trio plan to expand elsewhere in the city .
The Antioch restaurant developed a one - of - a - kind partnership with a nearby elementary school to encourage childhood reading .
Students who meet their weekly reading goals get complimentary pizza and cinnamon rolls from Slim & Huskys .
The restaurant owners hope the partnership eventually becomes a citywide initiative .

Brunson : These 3 books are the best ever written on self - control and willpower Opening a restaurant was a leap of faith for Gray , Moore and Reed , three ambitious Nashville natives who are no strangers to entrepreneurship .
Though they entered the Nashville restaurant scene during a time of intense competition , especially for independent operators with limited capital , Slim & Huskys is expanding while many local eateries are struggling to drive sales .
The pizzeria was their second business venture , behind eco - friendly moving and storage company Green Truck Moving Co. , started in 2010 when they were all 25 .
They launched the moving company as a low - budget startup with rented trucks and it quickly took off . "
We developed our business just by bootstrapping and just working hard and so I think the community kind of gravitated to our differences in being green and being active in the community , " Gray said .
Gray said they had a longtime dream to open a restaurant , and they wanted to help revive the Buchanan area .
The name Slim & Huskys comes from an inside joke , since Gray and Moore would shop in the husky clothing section as kids and Reed would don slim fits . "
We figured starting a pizza company in an area that does nt have a whole lot of restaurants would be a great way to kind of help upstart that community back again and that s why we chose the Buchanan area , " Gray said .
Companies buying massive amounts of their own shares may be a key reason why certain sectors are doing better than others in the nine - year bull market for stocks .
On Monday , Yardeni Research said technology companies bought back $ 1 trillion worth of their shares since the beginning of the bull market in the first quarter of 2009 , followed by the consumer discretionary sector at $ 632 billion .
Apple represented about 20 percent of the technology sector 's total with $ 199.6 billion of share repurchases in the time period , according to its website .
The firm noted the two sectors were the top performing areas in the stock market .
Consumer discretionary shares rose 592 percent since March 2009 , while the technology sector rallied 511 percent .
The technology industry also led buybacks in the first quarter this year at $ 63.4 billion , leading to the second - best sector performance year to date at a 10 percent return , according to Yardeni . "
The buybacks help to explain the outperformance of the S&P 500 Information Technology sector so far this year , " strategist Ed Yardeni said in the note to clients .
Market research firm TrimTabs said earlier this week share buyback intentions reached a record high in the second quarter .
Corporations announced $ 433.6 billion in share repurchases during the period , nearly doubling the previous record of $ 242.1 billion in the first quarter .
In addition to the buyback surge , companies issued a record $ 111.6 billion in dividends during the second quarter , bringing the 2018 total to $ 220.8 billion , a 7.8 percent increase over the same period a year ago , according to Howard Silverblatt , senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones indices . --

Conservatives jumped on an error in a statement released Tuesday night by the organizers of last year 's Women 's March on Washington in response to President Donald Trump 's nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh .
The statement condemning Trump 's nominee , who would replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy , was released at 9:46 p.m. EDT , according to screenshots shared on social media .
It contained one glaring error : the name of the nominee had not yet been filled in . "
In response to Donald Trump 's nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States , The Women 's March released the following statement ... " the first sentence read .
In the next paragraph , the statement included the name , but it was misspelled as " Cavenaugh . "
An updated message with both errors corrected was sent out minutes later .
The mistake played into concerns among conservatives that Democrats planned to blindly oppose anyone Trump might choose to nominate . "
A number of our Democratic colleagues could not even wait until the president 's announcement last night before launching attacks on his nominee , " Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky . ,
said on the Senate floor Tuesday . "
This was , in some cases quite literally , a fill - in - the - blank opposition .
They wrote statements of opposition only to fill in the name later . "
White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said in a Fox News appearance that opposing Trump 's nominee before he or she was even named was " troubling " and " not the way a democracy and federalism is supposed to work . "
Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , pointed to the Women 's March statement as proof that he was correct when he said Sunday that Trump " could nominate George Washington and the left would go crazy . " "
There 's so many groups on the left declaring war on President Trump 's nominee , even before they knew who he was , " Graham said in a video posted to his Twitter feed Tuesday .
The Women 's March responded to the criticism , saying in a tweet , " Senator Graham is right .
We did prepare a press release in advance because we knew that all the people on Trump 's nominee list would strip protections for almost every marginalized group in the United States for years to come . " "
The @GOP and leaders like @LindseyGrahamSC and @SenateMajLdr seem to care more about a typo in a press release than they do about the future , safety , and rights of women , children , and our nation 's most marginalized communities , " the group said in another tweet .
The group went on to explain why it sees Kavanaugh as " especially dangerous " in a series of tweets . "
Kavanaugh has used the bench to undermine access to abortion for women , " the Women 's March tweeted . "
Were not fooled by the argument that Kavanaugh is nt a ' bomb - thrower ' or that he s made no extreme controversial rulings , " read another tweet . "
In our opinion , creating and supporting barriers to women seeking to make choices about our own bodies is pretty extreme . "
Whether or not their opposition was predetermined , the Democratic leadership in the Senate is ready to stand beside the Women 's March in the effort to block Kavanaugh . "
I will oppose Judge Kavanaughs nomination with everything I have , and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same , " Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in statement after Kavanaugh was nominated Monday . "
The stakes are simply too high for anything less . "

Consumers may be opening up their wallets wide right now , but a long - time Wall Street researcher warns strong spending is on borrowed time .
DataTrek Research co - founder Nicholas Colas predicts it 's on the verge of dangerously weakening due to tariff risks -- a situation that could ultimately push stocks much lower . "
That trade war issue ... really is top of mind for me , " he said this week on CNBC 's " Trading Nation . "
Colas cites low unemployment as the main reason why Americans have felt so good about spending money .
The latest monthly reading put the unemployment rate at 3.8 percent . "
So far , employers [ and ] companies have not really thought about the effect of trade wars in context of capital budgeting , capital planning , hiring , " Colas said .
Colas believes President Donald Trump 's tariff threats have already harmed corporate America by leaving companies no choice but to re - assess their business plans whether a trade war happens or not .
He expects companies to begin scaling back hiring and capital - expense spending in coming months to address uncertainty .
Once that happens , he said , the employment rate will inevitably tick up and consumers will tighten their purse strings out of fear . "
That s the beginning of the economy rolling over , and with that stocks , " Colas said .
Corrections & Clarifications : An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the space mission would take two days .
It will take two months .
Israel 's space division and an Israeli aerospace nonprofit announced Tuesday that a mission to the moon will launch in December .
If successful , the country would become the fourth nation to land on the moon and the first to use a small spacecraft .
In a press conference in Yehud , Israel the Israel Aerospace Industries Space division and the nonprofit SpaceIL relayed their plans to launch an unmanned lunar spacecraft , weighing a relatively light 1,322 pounds , from Cape Canaveral , Florida in December .
After a two - month journey , the spacecraft should land on the moon Feb. 13 , 2019 , to plant an Israeli flag and to collect scientific data . "
After eight challenging years , I am filled with pride that the first Israeli spacecraft , which is in its final construction and testing phases , will soon be making its way to the moon , " said South African - Israeli billionaire and president of the SpaceIL , Morris Kahn , in a statement . "
The launch of the first Israeli spacecraft will fill Israel , in its 70th year , with pride . "
The moon launch is the product of SpaceIL 's participation in Google 's Lunar XC Prize competition that initially promised a $ 20 million prize for the first non - governmental organization to land an unmanned spacecraft on the moon by 2014 .
Israel joined the competition set on joining the ranks of the United States , Russia and China in reaching the moon .
No organization could meet this deadline , however , and the competition ended in March with no winner .
SpaceIL was created in 2011 by three engineers , Yariv Bash , Kfir Damari and Yonatan Winetraub and partnered with Israel Aeronautics Industries .
The group continued its work after the competition ended in hopes to " fulfill the dream of reaching the moon , " according to SpaceIL .
The plan is for the small spacecraft to latch on a rocket from Elon Musk 's SpaceX company from the Florida launch point in December .
It will then disconnect from the Falcon over 37,000 miles above earth to enter an orbit , expand and get captured by the moon 's gravity .
The organization runs on private donations to support its $ 95 million project , with $ 88 million needed for the spacecraft 's construction .
Kahn , president of SpaceIL , has donated $ 27 million .
Israel hopes this space mission starts an " Apollo effect , " getting Israelis pumped up about the prospect of space and capturing the minds of children in hopes to inspiring them to study science , technology , engineering and mathematics , the organization said .

Crime does nt pay -- unless you re a whistleblower .
An unidentified person who told regulators about illegal activity at a financial institution will walk away with approximately $ 30 million , the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced Thursday .
Its the biggest award the watchdog agency has handed out since launching its whistleblower program in 2010 .
The CFTC did not disclose which company or companies were implicated by the whistleblowers revelations , but news reports identified the informant as a Florida financial investigator who alerted authorities about a conflict of interest at JPMorgan Chase JPM , -0.59 % .
Both the CFTC and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the whistleblowers identity .
The CFTC awarded the payout because the informant provided " specific , timely and credible " information that prompted CFTC staff to launch an investigation , according to a redacted version of the CFTC order authorizing the monetary award . "
We hope that an award of this magnitude will incentivize whistleblowers to come forward with valuable information , " said CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo .
However , money is nt necessarily the best incentive to encourage people to step forward with damaging information , research shows .
What really makes whistleblowers come forward Whistleblowers are often motivated by a strong sense of justice and fairness that outweighs whatever loyalty they feel to their employer , said Adam Waytz , a psychologist at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management who co - authored a 2015 paper on the psychology of whistleblowers . "
A lot of whistleblowers tend to be folks who feel they have some kind of higher calling , " Waytz said . "
Some have a real sense of patriotism , some have a sense of even religiosity .
They are people who feel some higher loyalty than the parochial loyalty they feel to the organization they belong to . "
Because of their " moral thrust , " money is not the primary motivator for many whistleblowers , he said .
For example , a Deutsche Bank whistleblower refused an $ 8 million payout from the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2016 because regulators had only fined the company and not punished the executives responsible for the wrongdoing . (
A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman declined to comment at the time . )
Famed whistleblower Edward Snowden said he felt compelled to give up a " comfortable life " ( and a six - figure job ) to leak classified documents to the press exposing the National Security Agencys surveillance of Americans . "
I m willing to sacrifice all of that because I ca nt in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy , Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they re secretly building , " Snowden told the Guardian in 2013 .
A 2010 New England Journal of Medicine study of whistleblowers in the pharmaceutical industry found that financial gain was nt what pushed people to come forward .
Instead , informants were motivated by " integrity , altruism or public safety , justice and self - preservation . "
People tend to underestimate whistleblowers " pro - social " motivations , meaning their desire to help others , said James Dungan , a postdoctoral researcher at University of Chicagos Booth School of Business who coauthored the 2015 whistleblower study .
In fact , offering huge payouts as a way to entice more whistleblowing could actually have the opposite effect , he told MarketWatch .
Americans donate more than $ 1 billion a day .
Here 's how Big rewards may actually backfire While whistleblowers themselves may only be motivated by moral considerations , outsiders may fixate on the money , Dungan said . "
Its possible that adding extremely large incentives for blowing the whistle may backfire by simultaneously increasing the backlash that whistleblowers often receive from their peers , " Dungan said in an email .
In other words , people may think , " They do nt care about the company , they are only in it for the money , " he added .
Who is the typical whistleblower ?
Previous research has suggested that employees who are likely to reveal wrongdoing tend to be higher - ranking , well - paid men who have been with the organization longer than others .
That could be because more powerful people are less likely to be punished for violating an organizations sense of unity .
Its illegal for companies to retaliate against workers who alert authorities about wrongdoing , said CFTC spokeswoman Donna Faulk - White But whistleblowers are nt always employees . "
A whistleblower need not be an insider ; under our program , any member of the public can be a whistleblower , including a harmed investor or other market participant , " Faulk - White said .
Huge payouts could shrink soon The CFTC considers several factors in determining the size of whistleblower awards , including the significance of the information and how helpful the whistleblower is to investigators , Faulk - White said .
Under CFTC rules , the awards must be between 10 % and 30 % of the total amount the agency collects in the resulting enforcement action .
Prior to this award , the highest ever amount given to a CFTC whistleblower was $ 10 million in 2016 .
In 2017 , the CFTC saw a 28 % drop in enforcement actions , with the agency collecting $ 413 million in fines or penalties , down from $ 1.29 billion in the previous year .
Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission awarded its highest ever payouts , when one whistleblower received $ 33 million and another two split nearly $ 50 million .
Those big payouts prompted the SEC in June to propose limiting whistleblower awards , over concerns they may be getting " too large , " according to the proposal .
An attorney who represents whistleblowers called the proposed limits a " bad idea . " "
It could deter whistleblowers from disclosing the largest frauds , " attorney Jason Zuckerman told MarketWatch in June . "
Significantly , whistleblowers have been instrumental in halting ongoing fraud schemes .
Congress wisely chose not to impose a cap on SEC whistleblower awards and the SEC should refrain from doing so . "

Cristiano Ronaldo will leave Real Madrid and join Italian Serie A side Juventus in a $ 117.3 million deal , the Spanish club announced on Tuesday .
In a stunning move that first emerged as a possibility just a week ago and immediately sent shockwaves through soccer , the Portuguese forward committed his immediate future to Juve , winner of the past seven Italian league titles .
His acquisition is a spectacular coup for Juventus , even at a cost of around $ 36 million per year in salary , over the four - year term of Ronaldos contract .
At 33 , it may be his last deal .
Ronaldo spent nine years in Madrid , joining from Manchester United in 2009 in what was then the most expensive transfer in soccer history .
With Real Madrid , he firmly established himself as one of the two best players of this generation , alongside Lionel Messi of Barcelona and Argentina .
MORE SOCCER : During his time in Spain , he won four Champions League titles , two La Liga championships and three FIFA Club World Cups .
He was also awarded the Ballon d'Or - given annually to the world 's best player - five times , and helped Portugal to the 2016 European Championship crown .
However , his relationship with Madrid soured over time , with the club unwilling to incrementally increase his salary every time another player , such as Messi , signed a contract bigger than Ronaldos .
Ronaldo also became frustrated by what he came to see as interference from the Spanish tax authorities , who earlier this month levied a $ 21.7 million fine that allowed the player to avoid prison time , according to Spanish press reports . "
Today , Real Madrid wants to express its gratitude to a player who has proved to be the best in the world and who has marked one of the brightest times in the history of our club and world football , " a club statement read . "
Beyond the ( titles ) , the trophies achieved and the triumphs achieved during these nine years , Cristiano Ronaldo has been an example of dedication , work , responsibility , talent and improvement . "
For Real Madrid , Cristiano Ronaldo will always be one of his great symbols and a unique reference for the next generations .
Real Madrid will always be your home . "
Ronaldo leaves Madrid as the clubs all - time top scorer , with 451 goals in 438 games .
A switch to Juventus was made possible in part by the close relationship between his agent , Jorge Mendes , and the Agnelli family , which owns Juventus and the Fiat / Ferrari automobile empire .
The timing of the announcement , hours before France faced Belgium in the World Cup semifinal , was likely no mistake .
USA TODAY Sports wrote last weekend that timing his move to upstage the latter part of the World Cup would be " in character " for Ronaldo , whose Portugal team was eliminated by Uruguay in the round of 16 .

Cryptocurrency projects have been popping up left , right and center in the past 18 months , but over 800 of those are now dead , adding to comparisons between the current digital coin market and the dotcom bubble in 2000 .
New digital tokens are created via a process known as an initial coin offering ( ICO ) where a start - up can issue a new coin which investors can buy .
The investor does n't get an equity stake in the company , but the cryptocurrency that they buy can be used on the company 's product .
People usually buy into an ICO because the coins are cheap and could offer big returns in the future .
There has been an explosion in ICOs .
Companies raised $ 3.8 billion via ICOs in 2017 , but in 2018 so far , this number has already shot up to $ 11.9 billion , according to CoinSchedule , a website that tracks the market .
However , hundreds of these projects are now dead because they were scams , a joke or the product has n't materialized .
Dead Coins is a website that lists all the cryptocurrencies that fall into those categories .
So far , it has identified just over 800 digital tokens that it considers dead .
These coins are worthless and trade at less than 1 cent .

Dan Caplinger The Motley Fool The tax reform package that became law late last year had substantial impacts on American taxpayers .
Major changes to the standard deduction , various credits and itemized deduction provisions , and individual tax rates left many people confused about whether they 'd end up saving money or paying more on their individual returns .
Yet there 's one area where tax reform unambiguously resulted in lower taxes : the corporate tax rate .
Prior to tax reform , the U.S. had a corporate tax rate that was just under 39 % .
That consisted of a 35 % federal tax rate on corporate income , with the remainder coming from state - level taxes that most U.S. states impose .
That put the U.S. in the top three countries in the world in terms of corporate tax , according to figures last year from the Tax Foundation .
Now , though , federal rates on corporate income have fallen from 35 % to 21 % .
That puts the total federal and state burden at around 24 % , just above the worldwide average of roughly 23 % .
Still , even when you ignore tax havens with little productive economic activity , the new U.S. rate is far from the lowest level you 'll find .
Among major industrialized nations , Hungary leads the way , and Ireland is n't too far behind .
Proponents of tax reform argue that lower corporate tax rates will boost business profits , leading to greater levels of economic activity that should result in higher wages over time .
Opponents argue that lower business tax rates will only concentrate more wealth in the hands of high - income taxpayers .
For many businesses , the biggest benefit of tax reform will come not from lower rates but rather from simplified calculations .
With some complex tax breaks going away to help pay for lower tax rates , companies hope that the new tax regime will be easier to navigate as well as result in lower cost .

Dana Whites Contender Series 12 took place Tuesday , and were grading the winners from the five - fight card , which streamed on UFC Fight Pass from The Ultimate Fighter Gym in Las Vegas .
With a refreshing but digestible format that has fans of the sport responding , this series has shown to have legs beyond its summer seasons while serving as a crockpot for contenders whom the UFC matchmakers can use for future events .
With that trend in mind , I ve decided to take a look at the winning fighters regardless of whether or not they won a UFC contract while grading their performances in regards to their probability of returning to a UFC stage . * * * *
Jalin Turner Weight class : Lightweight Result : Jalin Turner def .
Max Mustaki by first - round TKO ( doctors stoppage ) Grade : A Summary : Its hard to downgrade a fighter for things outside of his control , which is why I m giving Jalin Turner an A. A Michael Bisping sparring partner who shows more than just athletic potential , Turner opened as the clear favorite over Max Mustaki .
And though the fight - which was hitting an increasingly high temperature - ended somewhat anticlimactically in the corner , there were still a lot of positives to take away .
Firstly , I have to commend Mustaki for showing the heart and toughness to take the offensive waves he did while still being able to fire back with enough vigor to keep us all on the edge of our seats ( and doing so with a broken foot , no less ) .
Still , it was the composure of Turner was what I found most impressive .
The 23-year - old southpaw kept his cool no matter how close success seemed on the horizon while stalking his prey calmly and changing up his shot selection and timing .
He dug brilliantly to the body with both punches and kicks .
That kind of style is not only pleasing to the technical eye , but also easily digestible to the action - hungry audiences that this series is designed to appeal to .
Turner may not have scored a contract , but Dana White made sure to state that officials have their eye on him - and smartly so .
There s a ton of athletic upside to the 6-foot-3 lightweight , who already fights beyond his years .
Given that Turner is still young and competes in what is traditionally the deepest division , I m not sure hell be on the shortlist for last - minute replacements on a televised card , but I could see him making another appearance on a future Contender Series show sooner than later .

Riley Dutro by third - round TKO Grade : A Summary : In what was arguably the most complete performance of the evening , Jordan Espinosa was able to score a stoppage just seconds before the final bell in what was his second Dana Whites Contender Series fight .
Pitted against Hawaiian prospect Riley Dutro , Espinosa opened as a nearly 2 - 1 underdog .
But by the start of the bout , it was clear that this was closer to a pickem contest with each fighter exchanging hooks on multiple occasions , taking turns dropping one another in almost comical fashion .
The durable Dutro continued to relentlessly stalk his opponent , but Espinosas check - hooks proved to be more concrete than coincidence and allowed him to punctuate exchanges and sting his stalking foe .
Espinosa was also able to threaten with a nice palm - to - palm grip from the front - headlock early , briefly putting the Brazilian jiu - jitsu brown belt in some precarious positions .
Ultimately , it was the patience and persistence of Espinosa that paid off , putting a cap on things with a beautiful hook in the closing seconds of the third .
Referee Mark Smith appeared to catch some flack from White on the stoppage , but the slumping and shelling motion from Dutro - albeit brief - was a body language that would ve triggered a lot of refs in that situation .
Luckily for Espinosa , the call to stop the fight did nt appear to damper the boss mans mood too badly considering that White ended up going over the heads of his matchmakers to award the 28-year - old flyweight a contract .
And given the seemingly constant extra cabinet space of that division , as well as past accusations of Whites attitude toward it , I believe that this was the right move .

Toby Misech by unanimous decision Grade : B Summary : In one of the two fights to go to decision during the evening , I found it hard to justify a higher grade for Ricky Palacios despite him delivering a performance that was otherwise solid .
Palacios faced Toby Misech , who is an explosive Hawaiian southpaw who started quickly out of the gate .
The problem , however , is that Misech could nt appear to keep the pace he was setting , and he steadily slowed by the middle of each round .
In said time , Palacios was able to smartly weather the storms , picking his spots to return while his slow - burn stylings began to pick up speed .
The 31-year - old Mexican - American never shied away from the fight , but you could also get the feeling that both he and his corner knew he was well ahead on the scorecards , which unfortunately may have quietly taken some of the suspense from the contest - especially when weighing what the format of the series is designed to produce .
Do nt get me wrong : I believe Palacios did the right thing tactically and fought well , but if he was planning on convincing White and the UFC matchmakers that they need another featherweight on their roster , there were probably some things he could have done differently to ensure that .
I do nt suspect Palacios is on the shortlist for last - minute stand - ins , but it would nt shock me to see him make a return to the Contender Series should he rack up some finishes on the regional scene .

Alton Cunningham by first - round TKO Grade : A Summary : As far as fast finishes go , its hard to ask for much more from Bevon Lewis , who had to put in only roughly three minutes of work to earn himself a UFC contract .
Lewis opponent , Alton Cunningham , was also undefeated at 5 - 0 but unfortunately never got to get started .
Lewis came storming out of the gates as if the bout was already predetermined , landing a stunning right hand in the opening stanzas with a laser - like focus .
From there , the Jackson - Wink MMA product began to pick away at his counterpart with everything from straight shots to oblique kicks , eventually finding his way into the clinch .
Although his tie - ups and hand - fighting acumen were not on the same level as his training partner Jon Jones , you can see where the comparisons come from when seeing all of Lewis characteristics at play .
Still , ultimately a fighter with a style of his own , Lewis embraced every position thrown at him during the brief contest until finishing things off with a few flush knees that caused the ref to step in .
With Lewis scoring the cleanest finish of the night , its safe to say we all figured he d be a shoo - in for a contract , especially when considering that his weight class is currently experiencing a youthful turnover that the 27-year - old prospect will fit nicely into .

Joey Gomez by split - decision Grade : B Summary : The headlining bout for Dana Whites Contender Series 12 featured the anticipated debut of Kevin Aguilar , who drew exciting Hawaiian up - and - comer Joey Gomez .
As a fan of the band Slayer , having a nickname like " The Angel of Death " is enough to get me excited .
But after Aguilars most recent knockout of respected prospect Thanh Le , everyone in the know seemed to be stoked for the 29-year - old Texan , who opened as nearly a 3 - 1 favorite before the public pushed it further .
But with that in mind , those expectations may have hampered the grade for an otherwise competitive and compelling fight .
Despite drawing blood on the Hawaiian early , Gomez - who is more known for his wrestling - put hands on Aguilar effectively , eventually securing a takedown and some control time to win him the round .
However , once the second round started , you could see Gomez having to go deeper into the gears to garner the same effect , subsequently eating more shots and accruing visual damage before getting his takedowns going again .
And by the third round , whether it was fatigue or otherwise , it was clear that Gomez let Aguilar back into what ended up becoming a competitive affair .
It was hard to be surprised at the judges coming to a split decision , but it was also hard knowing that neither man would likely earn a contract regardless of the outcome .
In Aguilars defense , he s a talent who s arguably ready for the next step being that he s a three - time defending champion in LFA who has experience against UFC names .
The eight - year pro is also a natural featherweight who took this bout on three weeks notice , against a sizable lightweight who holds a victory over the welterweight who just beat Jake Shields in the PFL , no less .
Given those reasons , as well as his fighting region , I suspect well see Aguilar turn up on one of the many midwest cards that the UFC keeps in rotation soon enough .

Danielle Page for KPMG For many mothers in the U.S. , maternity leave is still not a guarantee .
There 's currently no mandate in place requiring employers to offer paid time off for new moms .
Under the decades old Family and Medical Leave Act , eligible employees can take 12-weeks of unpaid leave .
Which leaves many women to make the tough call between forgoing time with their new baby , or suffering the financial consequences .
For professional golfer Stacy Lewis , being a sponsored athlete comes with an additional set of challenges . "
For a lot of women in this sport , you have to be willing to give up all your income for essentially a year to have a child , " Lewis explained . "
It 's really kind of ridiculous when you think about it .
Male professional athletes can take a week or two off and they 're right back at it .
It 's just a different deal for us , it 's a lot harder . "
The majority of sponsorship contracts are based on the number of tournaments an athlete competes in , with no clause or language that indicates what would happen in the event the player becomes pregnant within the contract 's duration .
Competing in a professional sport is pressure enough .
But for Lewis , knowing that she wanted to start a family meant having to prepare ahead of time , and play as frequently as possible while she still could . "
You put a lot of pressure on yourself , because it becomes , ' I just have to be able to make as much money as I can right now to support when I have these months where I 'm not going to be able to make anything , " she said .
What Lewis was n't prepared for was a call from KPMG , one of her sponsors , saying they planned on fulfilling her contract regardless of how many tournaments she played . "
It 's pretty unheard of , what KPMG did for me .
It was unexpected by me , and just unexpected across the board , " said Lewis .
But for Lynne Doughtie , U.S. Chairman and CEO of KPMG , it was a no - brainer . "
We 've had a long relationship with Stacy , and Stacy and her family are part of the KPMG family .
We wanted Stacy to have the same benefits that a KPMG employee would have , and there was really no big discussion about it .
It was more like , ' Of course we 're doing it . '
We feel so fortunate to have Stacy as part of KPMG , and to share in this big life moment for her .
It 's nice to be able to be a part of it , " said Doughtie .
In 2012 , Lewis became the first female athlete sponsored by KPMG , igniting the company 's many efforts to empower women through golf and its leadership initiatives . "
The whole purpose of the KPMG Women 's PGA Championship has been trying to elevate the experience for the LPGA Tour players , like ensuring they play on the best courses and receive national exposure via network TV coverage , which the men have for their championships , " said Doughtie .
KPMG 's continued sponsorship of Lewis marks the next step in striving toward that goal . "
We 're now at this point where we 're talking about the aspect of having children , and how we can continue to elevate the game and the awareness .
It 's been a journey , and Stacy has been a part of that from the very beginning and how we 've planned this whole championship from its inception , " Doughtie reflected .
As a firm , KPMG has earned a place on Working Mother magazine 's " Top Companies To Work For " list for almost two decades . "
KPMG 's focus has been ensuring we have the most inclusive and diverse workplace that we can have .
That means focusing on the benefits that are important for our women , for our working mothers .
For a long period of time we have evaluated things like part - time career tracks , sabbaticals , maternity benefits , etc . ,
which we continue to work on , " Doughtie explained .
Being that these benefits also have an obvious advantage for the business , it 's surprising more companies have n't caught on . "
You want to retain your very best talent .
Half of our workforce is women , so it 's important for us from a business perspective to ensure we keep that top talent within our firm , finding creative ways to make it work .
We 're continuing to explore ways that we can continue to support our employees as they 're going through one of the most important times of their lives when it can be really hard and stressful and challenging - and you want to take that stress away , " Doughtie said .
It 's a stress relief that Lewis will experience firsthand when she takes leave from the game starting mid - July . "
It really freed things up for me to be able to enjoy this year and this time more , " said Lewis .
As for the future of sponsorships for female athletes ?
Lewis hopes KPMG 's example will tee up a change in how these contracts are negotiated . "
Just calling my other sponsors and telling them what KPMG had done , their responses were , ' We never thought of that . '
I wanted to raise some awareness and hopefully change the way things are done down the road , " Lewis said .

Dave Adler BaseballHQ.com As the dog days of summer approach , some high - priced MLB talent currently resides in the dog house .
Batting average on balls in play ( BABIP ) can account for a low batting average .
Batters tend to establish their own rate that stabilizes over the years , so if its low after a few months , there s a fair chance BABIP and batting average will normalize over the rest of the season .
But sometimes , problems go deeper .
NATIONAL LEAGUE What s eating at the Washington Nationals Bryce Harper ( .212 BABIP ) ?
Could the possibility of a nine - figure free - agent contract be weighing him down ?
He s striking out more than usual , with whiffs in close to 40 % of his June plate appearances .
Other than that , the profiles fine - plenty of fly balls with a high launch angle and exit velocity consistent with years past .
With three month - plus DL stints in the past five years , Harper will always carry some health risk .
But if he stays on the field and starts making better contact , hell produce in the second half .
Ryan Braun ( .260 BABIP ) of the Milwaukee Brewers will always be tied to steroid use .
But when he got back from that suspension , he produced $ 30-plus seasons in 2015 and 2016 .
Lately , though , his launch angles been pretty low , contributing to a lot of ground balls .
He 's also striking out more than usual .
Age catches up with everyone , and at 34 , do n't count on a lot from Braun -- especially now that he s on the disabled list for a second time this season with a back issue .
After spending the first eight years of his career in Cleveland , NL - only owners were happy to see Carlos Santana ( .216 BABIP ) move to Philadelphia .
Talk about a tough start , he hit .153 with two home runs through the end of April .
While he s picked up the power pace , his batting average still lags behind .
Santanas another guy who makes fine contact ; the hits will start falling .
Plus , the friendly confines of Citizens Bank Park mean there s likely to be plenty of power to come .
When the front office calls you out publicly for lack of effort , its not a good look .
John Mozeliak , the St. Louis Cardinals president of baseball operations , recently noted that Dexter Fowler ( .201 BABIP ) would lose playing time until he reversed his plate woes .
With a batting average well south of .200 , who can blame him ?
Some encouraging trends exist : Fowler is making contact as usual and putting the ball in the air a lot .
But while a boost in launch angle looks good , a decrease in exit velocity makes many of those fly balls easy pop - ups .
Fowler will hit for better average in the second half -- how could he not ? --
but until he starts squaring the ball up , his production will be limited .
With 64 home runs in 2016 - 17 , there s no doubt the Cincinnati Reds Adam Duvall ( .233 BABIP ) is a power hitter .
But his batting average was only .245 over that span .
A history of big strikeout numbers means he s never going to hit for a high average .
But after a horrid April and May ( .181 average ) , Duvall has turned it around in June ( .263 ) .
Look for more production as his BABIP stabilizes .
While the Colorado Rockies Ian Desmond ( .244 BABIP ) has only a .214 average , he s clubbed 17 home runs .
So hell remain productive , right ?
Not so fast .
Desmond struggles to get the ball airborne , as more than 60 % of batted balls go on the ground .
Plus , over 40 % of the fly balls he s hit have left the yard -- an unsustainable percentage given his typical 15 - 18 % rate .
Sure , Coors Field helps , but there s no way Desmond keeps this up .
While his batting average may rise a bit , he wo nt keep hitting homers at the same pace .
AMERICAN LEAGUE Earning at least $ 20 in three of the last four years made the Minnesota Twins Brian Dozier ( .243 BABIP ) a popular middle infield choice in 2018 , rarely lasting until the end of the third round .
Those lofty expectations only make his 2018 performance more disappointing .
Perhaps looming free agency is in his head , also .
Doziers plate approach remains unchanged - he takes plenty of walks and strikes out at a league - average pace .
But there s been a power outage of sorts , with fewer fly balls leaving the yard .
With a five - year track record of solid contact and strong power , look for Dozier to make a statement in the second half .
As if the early season slump was nt enough to discourage New York Yankees fans , Gary Sanchez ( .194 BABIP ) now sits on the DL with a groin strain .
Sanchez 's plate approach looks similar to last year , striking out a tad too much , but with plenty of power .
His launch angle leads to plenty of fly balls and home runs .
Plus , at 22 , there s plenty of room to grow .
When Sanchez gets back into the lineup , look for a big contribution to New York 's playoff push .
High batting average and 32 home runs in 2017 made Jonathan Schoop ( .228 BABIP ) of the Baltimore Orioles a popular target on draft day .
Sure , he s missed time this year with an oblique injury , but he s disappointed when he s been on the field .
There are reasons for concern : Schoop is nt making hard contact , and he s lost a bit of exit velocity .
A drop in launch angle also saps some power .
Schoop has some swing mechanics to iron out before he can be counted on for a second - half surge .
Watch Jackie Bradley Jr. ( .254 BABIP ) patrol center field for Boston , and you understand his real - life value .
And he s produced at the plate before , with a .267 average and 26 home runs in 2016 .
But since the midpoint of 2017 , Bradley has nt produced much offensive value .
With a batting average hovering around the Mendoza line , he s striking out in roughly 30 % of his plate appearances .
It does nt help that Bradley puts the ball on the ground frequently with below - average power .
While Bradley is fun to watch in the outfield , do nt count on a big contribution at the plate .
In 2017 , the Oakland As Matt Joyce ( .235 BABIP ) hit the most home runs in his 10-year career , which was a bit of a surprise in the pitchers paradise of Oakland Coliseum .
He s been unable to sustain his gains this year , and losing time to a back injury has nt helped .
Although launch angle and exit velocity remain consistent with years past , Joyces power remains MIA .
Strikeouts limit any batting average upside , and his home park puts a cap on power , so do nt expect Joyce to pick up the pace much over the rest of the year .

Dear Moneyist , I am a 47-year - old woman living in New Jersey .
Currently , I own a duplex with a family member .
My boyfriend and I had been looking at houses for about six months .
We finally found one we both liked .
After the home inspection , it seemed to be out of reach with all repairs it needed .
At this point , he wanted to take out the mortgage himself and put me on the deed , with the agreement that the money I got from the sale of my home would go into the new house .
He also asked me take out a $ 20,000 loan to renovate my home to make more on the sale .
Since the original deal fell through , I decided not to look at more homes with him .
He is extremely picky and the process was just too much .
I told him to go with the realtor and , if he found a property he liked , then I would look .

He refused to show me paperwork and , when I asked him to call the lawyer to see what I needed to sign , he refused .
He told me that he was only putting the house in his name and I would still be required to pay money from my sale into the house .

I had him leave on our fourth anniversary as he told me about his plans to not include me and had not paid his bills for 3 months .
Do I have any recourse on the loan he insisted I take out for renovations ?
Is there anything I can do ?

We had no contract regarding rent .
I did not sign the contract for the home he is now buying .

You trusted him and you believe ( or believed ) in him .
That s a good trait .
Of course , there were red flags : paying his bills and buying stuff on Amazon for his band , pushing you to renovate your home with a $ 20,000 loan .
I trust you can cancel and/or repay it .
I hope you did nt give him any large sum of money for this new home .

Dear Moneyist , I am concerned that my family is money hungry .
My grandfather passed away and my uncle who lives overseas and my grandma took all the money out of my grandfathers bank account in less than 24 hours and put it in a bank account with only my uncles and grandmas names on the account .
My grandma and uncle are usually very precise with everything they do and my grandparents were married for 65 years , so its not like she forgot or did nt notice .
My mom found insurance checks written by my grandfather , but my grandma and uncle said there were no such thing -- and now they are hiding over a million dollars .
Read also : We plundered our 401(k ) to invest in a friends business -- now we fear its a Ponzi scheme My grandmother had four children , and she and one of her sons decided to do this without saying a word to the rest of the family .
The date of birth written on my grandfathers tombstone did not match the actual date .
How does that happen ?
They still have nt fixed it .
My mother lived in the family home with my grandparents the longest out of all of her four children and she was blindsided .
My uncle and grandma went down to the court house to make sure they were the only next to kin on the documents .
My uncle is now selling my grandfathers house and is keeping the money and there is no will because my grandmother destroyed it .
I just do nt know what to do .
Granddaughter in California How everything around you could soon turn into a subscription Dear Granddaughter , A will , if it exists , must be filed with the probate court in California within 30 days of the persons death .
That court makes sure the deceaseds creditors are paid before the remaining assets are distributed to the beneficiaries .
In order for you to prove there was a will , you will need evidence that a will did indeed exist .
A copy of the will in a bank vault or in your late grandfathers house would obviously be the best evidence that a will was destroyed .
Assuming that the only copy of the will was destroyed , that leaves you in something of a Catch 22 .
If there was no will or it was destroyed or lost , your grandfather died intestate and his estate will be divided in accordance with state law .
California is a community property state , so all community property -- that is , assets acquired during his marriage to your grandmother -- will go to her .
That likely includes life insurance and their home and his retirement accounts .
Given that there is more than one surviving child , your grandmother would then receive one - third of the remaining separate property from your grandfathers estate .
Do nt miss : My husband has terrible credit , so I m buying a house alone -- and I want pullout beds for his kids Is your grandmother of sound mind ?
She will receive the bulk of her late husbands estate .
If this uncle has undue influence over her , you may have a case .
You or one of your grandparents other children could take some concrete steps to ensure his estate is being handled appropriately .
One suggestion : File a petition to be an administrator of your grandfathers estate . "
You may also file a petition for an accounting , " according to The Grossman Law Firm , a company with offices in California . "
If there is evidence of theft criminal charges may be filed in a civil court . "
I do nt have an explanation for the headstone .
Perhaps your grandmother or the gravestone carver made an honest mistake .
If there was a will that mysteriously disappeared , this would be a foolish way to draw attention to such shenanigans .
In situations like this , its difficult to see one family member benefit over all others and , sometimes , conspiracy theories abound .
I recently heard from a woman who believed her father was murdered in their driveway .
I was nt convinced that her father was murdered and nor am I sure that your grandfathers will was spirited away .
Unless you find a will that leaves your grandfathers estate to his other children or there is evidence that your grandmother is being unduly influenced , you re out of luck .

Think : Wall Street investor versus non - profit environmentalist . )
My parents have set up trusts for their grandkids and funded college accounts , they ve recently re - done their wills , and we all have copies of everything .
Even with all their " affairs in order " given the shared properties and the strong personalities involved , I do anticipate some major drama in the ( hopefully distant ) future when my 80 year - old parents pass away .
My question is this : I recently looked online , and I believe the silver set my mother gave me to be worth $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 . (
I have not had it formally appraised , but its solid silver and there s a lot of it . )
Do nt miss : Should jewelry only be passed down to female family members ?
I am thinking of selling the silver set .
I am conflicted , however , because I do think the morally correct thing to do is tell my brothers that my mom gave me the tea set several years ago and give them the possible option of buying this family heirloom if they want it . "
My younger brother will be upset and tell me to leave it for the estate and my older brother will tell me that its a family piece and I have no right to sell . "
My younger brother will be upset and tell me to leave it for the estate -- he wo nt be able to afford to buy it -- and my older brother will be upset and tell me that its a family piece and I have no right to sell .
Hell want it and he will probably offer me less than what its worth .
I m not even sure my brothers realize this tea set is still around .
As a single parent I could use the cash .
Do I just quietly sell the silver set and hope that it is never missed ?
What if my mother asks about it ?
I know it was given to me , so it is rightfully mine but I feel like I am being dishonest not telling my brothers about it .
Morally Conflicted P.S. I do not wish my parents dead by ANY means , but with all this recent talk of wills , lock boxes , living wills and trusts , I am having a lot of thoughts about the future .
I am thinking of hiring an attorney when my parents pass , so that I do nt have to deal directly with my brothers regarding the estate .
I love my brothers both dearly but they are both very difficult , stubborn , and convinced they are right all the time .
Dear Conflicted , The person you should tell is your mother .
It was her silver tea set and she gave it to you in the hope that you would find pleasure in it .
There s only one way to find out if she would mind you selling it .
She has two other children with families and they too may get pleasure from something that is part of your familys history and , at the very least , knowing that it meant something more than the sum of its parts ( or its price tag ) to your mother . "
The silver tea set belongs to you , but you will feel better if you ask your mothers permission before selling it .
Otherwise , you will be walking on silver egg shells wondering if it will ever come out . "
The silver tea set belongs to you , but you will feel better if you ask your mothers permission before selling it .
Otherwise , you will be walking on silver egg shells wondering if it will ever come up in conversation .
What if your mother dies and , when going through her belongings , your brothers discover that you sold the silver tea set ?
They might argue that you had undue influence over your mother or , worse , that you stole it .
Also see : My son is responsible , my daughter stays in debt -- how do I split my estate ?
It would also be wise to get a note from your mother or have her include a Personal Property Memorandum in her will dividing up her valuable personal items equally between her children .
Some states such as Florida allow a Separate Writing , which documents tangible personal property to be distributed outside of a will .
That way , there is less room for favorites and resentment when her will is going through probate .
There are many ways to split this proverbial silver tea set .
Your mother could open a 529 college - savings for your child in lieu of such gifts .
Gabriel Katzner of the Katzner Law Group in Encinatas , Calif. recommends an auction of heirlooms with each family member receiving a certain amount of credits : " If an item is important to someone they can bid all their credits .
If less important they can bid few or no credits . "
The risk is that whomever ends up with the silver tea set may end up selling it too .

Dear Moneyist , My sister was trustee of our mothers accounts .
When our mom went into the nursing home and was incapacitated , my sister started writing checks in large amounts to her children--$10,000 at a time and , although her name was on the accounts with mom , it was to pay her bills , but my sister never paid them .
Also see : How can I ensure my husband and his lazy kids honor my will ?
At the time of death , she did pay a couple of bills , but never filed taxes or paid her nursing home costs and many other bills .
She also closed accounts and transferred money to her personal account claiming nothing was left .
She refused to give anyone an accounting .
She s a single mom of two kids who quit her job and has been going on many vacations and buying expensive things .
How do we make her pay up ?
Her name was also on the accounts does that mean she gets to keep it all ?
Distraught Daughter Dear Distraught , There are a lot of unknowns here .
But let me first deal with the issue of a trustee .
Trustees are not there to write checks for their friends and family .
They take responsibility for a family members bank accounts to pay necessary bills for medical costs , groceries , rent , utilities and , yes , nursing home costs .
They are supposed to taker care of the needs of the elderly relative .
Your sister appears to have abused that privilege .
Trustees are required by law to follow those mandates .
If you sister was , indeed , a trustee and a trust was set up for this purpose , she had a fiduciary duty to act in your mothers best interests .
Part of that responsibility involves keeping receipts and being completely transparent , informing family members of transactions .
In such cases where a person did not act responsibly and funds were misappropriated , the bank in question has been held liable .
But these cases are complex , and that s not always the case .
But there are other parts of your letter that remain unclear .
Was your sister a co - owner of this account or a co - signer ?
If it was the former , your sister is a joint owner and , unfortunately , can spend the money as she wishes .
She would also be liable for any debts on that account after your mothers death .
If it was the latter , your sister has the right to sign checks on your mothers behalf .
If she overspent , the co - signer would be responsible for those debts .
Also see : I am about to inherit $ 1.75 million -- should I buy a house in cash and pay off my wifes student loans ? "
If the person did not intend the joint owner to keep the asset on death , but instead only added the joint name as a convenience , then courts can and do order the asset to be turned over to the estate and shared with the other beneficiaries , " according to Andy and Danielle Mayoras , lawyers based in Troy , Mich. " This also applies to brokerage accounts , stocks , and other investments .
The key is always the intent of the person who added the name at the time it was created -- not afterward . "
If your sister was merely a co - signer , then you should hire a lawyer -- you may find one who would take on your case on a contingency basis -- and immediately contact the bank in question .
The fact that your mother handed over control of her finances to receive help with necessary bills , and your sister reneged on that help , should also make this a stronger case .
In some cases , but not all , banks have been held liable for the money withdrawn from accounts by a personal representative .
Many people do nt understand the difference between being a co - signer and a co - owner on a bank account .
There are so many cases of siblings listed as co - owners ( rather than authorized signers ) on those accounts who have emptied their parents bank account before and after they died .
Sometimes , siblings who have taken on this responsibility did not keep enough ( or any ) receipts and have been wrongly accused of emptying a parents account .
Find out your sisters status on this account first and , once you ve done that , you can decide whether or not you should pursue her for these misspent funds .
Do nt miss : I have terminal cancer .
Will my elderly mother be responsible for my credit - card debt ?

Dear Work It Out , I am 19 and in college and have recently started to build my career by attending tech conferences .
But I have found myself in a situation where no one will talk to me , and if I go up to them and start talking , the conversation is short .
Because I m a woman , and a young one , I get stared at a lot but will not have someone spark a conversation .
Or when someone rarely does talk to me , " No , I do not want to get dinner / drinks with you . "
My goal from networking is to learn .
How do you join a conversation when everyone is in little circles ?
What are you supposed to talk about ?
Like , " Hello , I am this random person ... " ?
If only we were taught this in school !
First of all , good for you for taking your career into your own hands and trying to make something happen for yourself while you re still in school .
I ve found that networking events can be hit or miss .
Sometimes you ll go and have superficial conversations , or maybe none at all , and get nothing lasting out of them .
Other times , a chance encounter could change your life .
I once met a lovely woman at a panel event who turned out to be a top exec at one of my favorite publications , and she set me up with a job interview .
Mastering the art of networking is a great goal , so I m going to let you in on a few secrets that I wish I d known at your age : 1 .
Its awkward for everyone Heres the truth : Most people in business hate networking events .
Its awkward !
No one really knows what to say or how to get past the " So , what do you do ? "
banalities .
But once you understand that , you can use it your advantage by actively seeking to make other people more comfortable .
When you take the initiative to introduce yourself and start a conversation , you ll often find that the other person is relieved .
So do nt wait around for other people to come to you .
Find an opening and say hello .
2 .
People love talking about themselves Wherever you go , people are just people .
And I ve found they all have a favorite subject -- themselves .
The best way to engage others in conversation is to ask them questions about themselves , their work and their opinions .
Ask things like : " What did you think of the speaker ? " "
Do you work with X in your field ? " "
How did you get into Y in the first place ? "
Really listen .
Smile and nod and encourage them to talk .
It will make them feel great , and you ll probably learn a lot too .
3 .
Being young can be useful OK , being young and a woman can be a problem .
I get it .
I started my career as a business journalist when I was 21 , and at events I was frequently mistaken for a PR assistant .
I m also only 52 " , so even today people still think I m younger than I am .
But hey , that s not the worst thing as you get older .
Plus , you wo nt be young forever , so you might as well use the benefits of youth while you can .
And there s a biggie when it comes to networking : Older people want to help young people .
Why ?
Its flattering when someone wants your advice .
It feels good to help someone who wants to follow in your footsteps .
Remember that .
If you want to get on someones calendar , say how much you admire their career and how appreciative you d be if they could spare 15 minutes to tell you how they got to where they are .
If you re genuine , schedules will clear fast .
4 .
Ease into social circles with a good icebreaker It is extremely intimidating to be alone at an event where everyone is talking in little circles .
I have a go - to strategy that , Ill admit , is nt for the faint of heart : I will walk up to a group of nice - seeming people and with a big smile say , " May I crash your circle ? "
It has worked for me every single time because , honestly , who s going to say " no " ?
Usually someone , or multiple people , say " Of course ! "
and then introduce themselves or fill me in on what they re talking about .
If that s a little too bold for you , you can also make eye contact with one member of the circle and start with , " Hi , my name is X. " Its a great idea to have some icebreaker questions prepared to get the conversation flowing .
Two of my favorites are , " What brings you to this event ? "
and , " Do you know anyone here ? "
5 .
Its all in the follow up

Delta Air Lines will roll out its new international - style premium economy seats to all of its widebody flights by 2021 , airline president Glen Hauenstein said on an earnings call Thursday .
The " Premium Select " seats , first announced by Delta in 2016 , began flying last year on the carrier 's new Airbus A350 widebody jets .
The new seats are now being added Delta 's Boeing 777 aircraft as part of a cabin retrofit to that plane type .
True international - style premium economy seats have long been a staple on international carriers , but they 've only recently caught on at U.S. carriers .
The seats are more than extra legroom , typically featuring recliner - type seats with extra width and recline .
They also typically come with meal and in - flight service that 's closer to business class than economy .
American became the first U.S. airline to add such a cabin to its international flights , debuting the product in 2016 .
United has just begun installing its own version of such a cabin .
TRIP REPORT : Reviewing the Delta One Suite with sliding privacy doors Delta 's rollout of its Premium Select cabin comes as it projects a $ 350 million revenue gain this year from premium seats , as an 8 percent gain in seating during the second quarter led to a 20 percent gain in revenue , executives said Thursday .
The categories include Delta One suites , Premium Select and Comfort Plus , according to Hauenstein .
Expansion plans continue .
Delta plans to offer Premium Select , which has been available in half its Pacific markets and is being added to trans - Atlantic flights this year , on all widebody flights to Europe by 2021 , Hauenstein said . "
This is really something that we continue to remain excited about , " Hauenstein told investment analysts during an earnings call . "
People really want to buy this from us . "
TODAY IN THE SKY : Delta shows off first Boeing 777 retrofitted with new cabin interior ( story continues below ) Part of the growth is from allowing customers since May 2017 to upgrade seats after buying them .
The move came in response to corporations limiting business travelers to coach seats , despite a willingness by travelers to pay more themselves . "
Quite honestly , we have nt made it that easy for them , " Hauenstein said . "
As we continue to roll out different ways to buy those products , we will see another explosion in demand as customers will use miles to sit in cabins where they want to sit . "
Delta expects to offer the option for upgrading seats with loyalty miles by the end of 2018 .
Fares are typically $ 25 to $ 35 higher for switching domestic flights from economy to Comfort Plus , Hauenstein said .
The international premium averages twice the revenue from economy , worth several hundred dollars per seat , he said .
Overall , Delta projects premium seating could generate an additional $ 500 million in 2019 , Hauenstein said .

Denise Phillips , a military veteran and mom who has three sons in the service , wanted to book a trip to Hawaii to spend Thanksgiving with one of her children .
But she did nt want to pay for the trip all at once .
So she started searching online for installment plans and found one through the lending company Affirm . "
I started looking into it , and it said ' No hidden fees , " she said . "
I tried it , and it was actually true . "
The experience was convenient , she said , and since that trip she s used Affirm to book more trips : One for a fishing trip to Alaska next month and she has plans to use it in January for a trip to Bermuda .
Affirm charges interest , but presents that total as a flat fee at the beginning of the payment process , which was more comforting than putting the big purchases on a credit card , she said .
The fee varies depending on the customers creditworthiness and the time period during which they plan to pay .
Phillips is nt alone .
In recent years , companies have increasingly allowed travelers to book airfare , hotels and amusement - park tickets , with the promise they ll pay later .
The airline JetBlue JBLU , -4.17 % announced in 2017 a partnership with the payments company UpLift , that allows customers to pay for flights in 12 monthly installments , with APRs starting at 8.99 % .
Similar companies , including Airfordable and BookIt.coms PayDelay , specialize in travel installment loans .
And lenders that typically offer personal loans , including Affirm and Marcus by Goldman Sachs , also advertise " travel " or " vacation " loans .
How cocktail home - delivery apps could disrupt the spirits industry Taking out a loan for a vacation is risky But financial experts say taking out a loan for a vacation can be a bad idea .
If someone absolutely has to book a trip , there might even be cheaper ways to do it , said Nick Clements , the co - founder of personal finance company MagnifyMoney .
One possibility : Credit cards with a 0 % interest - rate introductory period , he said .
That is , of course , if consumers can pay the full amount they put on the card before the introductory period is over .
What s more , not all installment plans work out as well as they did for Denise Phillips , said Rachel Podnos , an attorney and financial adviser based in Washington , D.C. Interest rates advertised as " low " still cost consumers more than they should be paying on a discretionary purchase like a vacation , she said .
At Affirm , the interest rate can be up to 30 % -- significantly higher than on a credit card , which has an average interest rate of 17 % , according to personal - finance website Bankrate .
Although there is a key difference : Affirm gives the total amount people will pay up front , and charges simple interest rather than compound interest .
Still , financing a vacation is " a terrible idea all around , " Podnos said . "
Its one thing to finance your education or home purchase , or even a car purchase in some situations ... but to finance a vacation is to me just insane .
If you ca nt afford to pay for your vacation out of cash on hand , do nt take a vacation . "
It sometimes makes sense to pay for hotels and flights early There are some times when splitting up payments for a vacation can pay off .
Ryan Anderson , a 25-year - old living in Champaign , Ill. , prides himself on his " travel hacking " skills and decided to take advantage when a Carnival Cruise Line CCL , -7.04 % vacation gave him the option of paying in installments .
He paid no fees to do that .
Ryan Anderson ( right ) split up a trip in order to use travel credits , but said he would never pay interest on a vacation .
Courtesy of Ryan Anderson He had the cash on hand .
But he decided to split the cost up so that he could use a $ 300 travel credit he gets with his Chase Sapphire Reserve JPM , -0.59 % credit card twice : Once in late 2016 and once in late 2017 .
He made his remaining payment on a Capital One COF , -1.54 % Venture card , to meet a minimum spending threshold . "
If I had to pay interest to go on a vacation , I just would nt go on a vacation , " he said .
There s another key way installments can pay off : If travelers can afford to book their flights or hotels earlier , they may be able to get better prices , said Tom Botts , the chief commercial officer at UpLift .
And it gives consumers an option when they have to take an immediate trip , he said , such as visiting a sick family member . "
Were not out there pushing people to take trips they should nt take , " he said . "
We believe altruistically that allowing people to do that on their own terms is a greatly unserved need . "
Despite an ugly first half of the year for digital currencies , which saw the value of all cryptocurrencies fall by more than $ 300 billion , investors were still hungry for exposure to the nascent technology , according to one digital asset management firm .
New York - based Grayscale Investments LLC said it raised a total of $ 248.4 million in the first half of the year , the strongest inflows of any six - month period since the companys inception in 2013 . "
As the investment community knows , over the last six months , the digital asset market experienced one of the largest price drawdowns since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009 , " said Grayscale in a July 18 report . "
However , what is more interesting , and somewhat counterintuitive , is that the pace of investment into Grayscale products has accelerated to a level that we have not seen before , " they said .
Of the money raised in the first half of 2018 , 56 % of it was institutional , bucking the narrative that this investor class remains on the sidelines . "
Grayscale is experiencing institutional inflow first hand , " said Michael Sonnenshein , managing director of Grayscale Investments . "
No question about it . "
Grayscale Investments Of the institutional inflow , the average investment was $ 848,000 .
Accredited individuals accounted for 20 % of the investment , with an average investment just shy of $ 300,000 .
On Tuesday , bitcoin BTCUSD , -0.83 % traded back above $ 7,000 , reaching a five - week high , but the worlds biggest digital currency remains down more than 40 % year to date .
Despite the poor start to the year , many investors and analyst commentary views the selloff as an opportunity . "
There s a narrative that interest has dwindled , " said Sonnenshein . "
We could not disagree more .
As prices have come down , investors have come off the sidelines -- they have viewed the falling prices as an opportunity . "
These comments mirror Coinbase VP Adam White who said on CNBCs Fast Money Monday , that conversations with institutional investors " have become more and more profound . "

DETROIT - Ford plans to get rid of the traditional Fusion sedan in favor of a longer , taller and more brawny version .
The new design , which has no scheduled release date , is intended to capture buyers who drive the Subaru Outback wagon and maybe even the BMW 5 Series hatchback , a luxury model .
2019 Ford Fusion adds safety , driver features " While current Ford Fusion production ends in a few years , well likely continue to use the name because of its awareness , positive imagery and value with consumers , " said spokesman Mike Levine . "
However , its too soon to speculate on what that new vehicle may look like . "
Previously , Ford has talked about creating a new , more SUV - like version of its Focus but has n't talked about Fusion other than to say it is one of the nameplates it would be retiring . "
All car sales are down , " Levine said . "
Were going where the consumer wants to go .
They want vehicles with more ride height , more interior space , more versatility .
Customers love the Fusion , but look at how vehicles are evolving .
Were pivoting to new silhouettes . "
No question , the Ford Fusion has a loyal following . "
Its been a good reliable car , a good seller for us over the last 10 years or so , " said Joe Wood , new car sales manager at Northgate Ford in Port Huron , Mich. " The fact that Ford is decreasing the number of cars alarms people who are loyal Fusion buyers .
Keeping the name , a solid name brand , would be a smart idea . "
Industry analysts are watching Ford and its Focus redesign with interest . "
Ford is looking to spoil Subaru 's impressive sales growth with a ' lifted wagon , ' " said Dave Sullivan , manager of product analysis at AutoPacific . "
This type of car is really the anti - SUV .
It looks to have all of the functionality and utility of a crossover without the stigma of hauling kids or groceries .. " The plan to move out of cars into trucks and SUVs is a consistent message emphasized and re - emphasized by Ford .
Yet some industry observers question the strategy of moving away from the Fusion sedan to a bigger silhouette . "
There s not a lot of sales volume in the sport wagon , " said Eric Noble , a product development consultant and professor of vehicle technology at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena , California . "
When Ford announced it was dropping the Fusion , three or four other mid - sized carmakers danced . . "
He questioned whether Ford CEO Jim Hackett is exercising questionable judgment while bowing to pressure from investors upset about underwhelming stock performance ; the dramatic announcement to eliminate the Fusion sedan move and some other cars to the more lucrative SUVs and trucks is nt a short - sighted strategy .
Apart from the iconic Mustang , all Ford cars are on the chopping block . "
Why change a winning recipe like the Ford Fusion sedan ?
This makes no sense , " Noble said . "
The car is made in Mexico .
If Ford ca nt make a profit off the Fusion , there s a bigger problem . "
In 2017 , consumers purchased 209,623 Fusions and 188,886 Outbacks , according to manufacturer sales data .
In 2018 , Fusion sold 86,978 vehicles while Outback sold 90,978 vehicles .
Fusion sales have continuously declined over the past few years while Subaru has gained sales overall .
Levine said no time frame has been established for the Fusion redesign or its reveal .

DETROIT - In March of 2016 , Keith Reynolds flew from California to Atlanta so he could claim his spot in line at 4 a.m. , and get a three - hour head start on his West Coast competitors .
Tesla ( TSLA ) was taking $ 1,000 deposits for its new electric car , the Model 3 , priced starting at $ 35,000 .
And Reynolds had to have one .
He managed to land near the top of the waiting list .
Flash forward more than two years , through much - publicized production delays .
Reynolds is still waiting .
And now , like others in the U.S. on a waiting list of about 420,000 worldwide , he worries that the looming phaseout of a $ 7,500 federal tax credit will put the cost of the car out of his reach . "
The tax credit was going to be huge , " said Reynolds , 45 , who works in digital advertising , lives in Laguna Hills , California , and drives a 9-year - old Audi A3 compact car .
Last week , Tesla sales hit 200,000 since the start of 2010 -- the point at which federal law requires the credit for rechargeable electric vehicles to be phased out .
Tesla buyers will continue to get the full credit through the end of the year .
Then it drops to $ 3,750 for six months and $ 1,875 for another six months before ending entirely on Dec. 31 , 2019 .
That means buyers need to be behind the wheel of a new Tesla by the end of the year to get the full $ 7,500 tax break -- essentially a 21 percent discount off the base model 's sticker price .
Many Model 3 customers will tire of waiting and drop out , predicted Dave Sullivan , manager of product analysis at AutoPacific , an auto research and consulting firm . "
By then , they will have been waiting for three years possibly , " he said .
Tesla declined to comment on the possibility of losing buyers from the waiting list .
But if buyers bail , it could put the company 's future in peril , costing sales and desperately needed cash flow for Tesla at a critical time in its 15-year history .
Tesla is using the Model 3 to move from being a niche maker of expensive electric cars for the wealthy to an automaker for the masses .
CEO Elon Musk has promised to turn a profit in the second half of this year , but Tesla has lost money in all but two quarters in its eight years as a public company .
In the first three months of this year it burned $ 1 billion as it ramped up Model 3 production at a Fremont , California , factory .
The company had $ 2.7 billion in cash at the end of March .
In March , Moody 's Investor Service sounded an alarm , downgrading Tesla 's debt into junk territory and warning that it wo n't have cash to cover $ 3.7 billion for normal operations , capital expenses and debt that comes due early next year .
Tesla has said Model 3 sales will generate cash and create profits .
Musk began sleeping at the factory in an effort to fix automation and other problems that much of the year held output to around half of the goal he set last summer of 5,000 Model 3s per week .
The company built a heavy - duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s and said it reached 5,000 per week at the end of June .
Like many of those still on the waiting list , Reynolds wants to order a Model 3 priced closer to the $ 35,000 base .
The cheapest version only comes in black , with other colors costing at least $ 1,000 more .
At present , Tesla is selling only pricier versions with longer - range battery packs .
The last time Reynolds configured one on Tesla 's website , the lowest price was $ 49,000 , beyond what he can afford .
He wants the car badly enough that he 'll spend over $ 40,000 , as long as California and federal credits still cut the price to around $ 35,000 .
He 'll hang on until the end of this year .
Beyond that , he said he 'll likely drop out if there 's no federal credit and " if no configuration options are made for the frugal , penny - pinchers like myself . "
Others on the waiting list interviewed by The Associated Press said they were worried about losing the tax credit .
Several recent buyers and customers on Tesla internet forums expressed similar concerns .
Most Tesla buyers who already got the tax credit -- about 120,000 -- are wealthier people who did n't need it to buy Tesla 's more expensive Model S and Model X , which can cost over $ 100,000 , said Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid .
He said the tax law should have had an income limit for eligibility . "
If you can afford to buy a $ 140,000 Tesla , you do n't really need the incentive , " he said .
The only other automaker that 's close to losing the tax credit is General Motors ( GM ) , which has sold about 185,000 electric cars and should hit 200,000 early next year , according to the Edmunds.com auto pricing site . (
Edmunds regularly provides content , including automotive tips and reviews , for distribution by The Associated Press . )
Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland put down a refundable $ 1,000 deposit on a Model 3 in April 2016 because she believes in Musk 's crusade to cut auto emissions to zero .
Three months ago , she canceled her order , partly because of the delays , partly because she now wants a hatchback .
Lindland also wondered if she 'd ever get the car . "
I 've already been on the list for two years , " she said . "
I need all - wheel - drive , and I would have to wait another year . "
She does n't think Tesla will be able to keep making 5,000 cars per week , and she is skeptical of the cars ' quality and worried that Tesla could run out of money , unable to service vehicles .
Christian Kingery , a Seattle - area web developer , was among the first to order a Model 3 in 2016 .
He wanted a loaded version with all - wheel - drive for rainy weather but was troubled by the prospect of losing federal and Washington state tax credits .
He compromised and ordered a rear - drive version in April .
But his delivery date was delayed , costing him the Washington credit , which he says was worth $ 3,000 before it expired in May. When all - wheel - drive became available , he switched his order , pushing delivery to September .
Although Kingery is frustrated , he still wants the car . "
Tesla is doing something that no other carmaker is doing , in a way that no other carmaker is doing , " he said .
Like Reynolds and Lindland , he knows about the Model 3 's impressive handling , 310-mile battery range and futuristic interior with all the controls on a touch screen .
He 'll just have to wait a little longer to drive one .
Deutsche Welle A 24-year - old American tourist caused panic at Vienna Airport when she put an unexploded World War II artillery shell in front of Austrian customs officials and asked whether the " souvenir " could be taken on board her flight home .

Deutsche Welle An $ 8,100 reward has been offered for information that leads to the arrest of a wolf killer , the German Organization for the Protection of Wolves announced on Wednesday .
The reward is tied to the killing of a 1-year - old wolf in Saxony , whose body had been found on June 10 floating in a lake near the city of Bautzen .
An examination of the wolf 's corpse by a Berlin wildlife research institute found that the young female had been fatally shot in the chest and then had a rope tied around her stomach and lashed to a concrete weight . "
This once again proves that a wolf is not a beast ; man is , " said Brigitte Sommer , the chairwoman of the German Organization for the Protection of Wolves .
The reward was issued by Sommer 's organization along with the district of Bautzen and a Facebook group called , " Wolves : Yes , Please . " "
Seven thousand euros should help loosen the tongues of anyone who knows anything , " Sommer added .
Wolves are protected by EU and German law , and killing them is a crime .
Bautzen 's district administrator declared the killing a crime , and Saxony 's State Criminal Police Office is investigating .
According to German law , punishment for killing a wild wolf includes a monetary fine in the thousands of euros or , in certain cases , up to five years in prison .
According to the Wolves in Saxony wildlife group , eight illegal wolf deaths have been identified in the state since 2009 .
The wolf population in Germany has been the subject of national debate , with politicians and interest groups split over how to best manage their increasing numbers .

Deutsche Welle An enormous crocodile that had long eluded authorities in Australia 's northern outback has finally been captured , officials said Tuesday .
Rangers found the 16.4-foot giant in a trap downstream from the Northern Territory town of Katherine -- almost 10 years after it was first spotted in the region .
Weighing up to 1,322 pounds , it 's the biggest saltwater croc ever to be removed from the remote Katherine River area . "
We 've called it a lot of things over the years because it 's been so hard to catch , " senior wildlife officer John Burke told public broadcaster ABC . "
It is a bit of a thrill , but you 've also got to admire the size of the animal and how old it is .
You 've got to have a bit of respect for it . "
The animal , which is estimated to be up to 60 years old , was sedated and taken to a nearby crocodile farm , where it will live out the rest of its days away from the local human population .
There are more than 150,000 crocodiles in Australia , where they are a protected species .
In an effort to prevent potential croc attacks , rangers routinely trap the animals and move them away from areas populated by humans .
Last year rangers relocated 371 crocodiles from the Northern Territory cities of Darwin , Katherine and Palmerston , according to government figures .

Does that lunchtime aerobic workout or afternoon meditation really help you become a happier , healthier and more productive employee ?
Health insurers and fitness gurus have long said that wellness programs can reduce medical spending , increase productivity , and improve well - being .
However , a study released in June from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign found little evidence to support those claims .
Researchers randomly selected people to participate in a wellness program at a workplace of more than 12,000 employees and found little difference in results for those who participated versus those who did not , said David Molitor , a co - author on the study .
Worker absenteeism , productivity , and general level of health showed no change in the first year of participating in the program , the study showed .
Researchers suggested past studies may have shown people enrolled in wellness plans improved their health because those who join voluntarily are already more likely to be healthy . "
Workplace wellness is a big phenomenon in the U.S. , but our program did not show it has a large effect on outcomes , " he said .
The program used in the study began with a biometric health screening and assessment of lifestyle habits .
After the screening , participants were given suggestions for lifestyle improvements and wellness activities that they could do through their workplace .
These included in - person classes on chronic disease management , weight management , tai chi , physical fitness , financial wellness , and healthy workplace habits , a " tobacco cessation hotline , " and an online , self - paced wellness challenge .
Wellness has been a trend in the corporate world in recent years , with companies introducing in - house doctors , health clinics , yoga studios , and even stress - relieving dogs to the office place to improve employee health .
The perks are designed to make employees healthier and more productive .
In some cases , employers are even asking employees to wear fitness trackers .
Some 13 million fitness trackers are estimated to be introduced to the workforce by the end of 2018 .
Medical spending remained nearly the same for people who participated in the wellness program , at $ 568 annually for the control group versus $ 576 for those in the program .
People in the wellness program had an average of 5.9 annual gym visits compared to 5.8 for those who did not .
Because low - income workers are less likely to participate in wellness programs , they lose out financially , because their salaries are essentially paying for perks they do nt use . "
Wellness programs may effectively increase insurance premiums for low - income workers in poor health , " Damon Jones , a co - author on the study , said .
The study also looked at how best to incentivize employees to participate in health screenings in the workplace .
Nearly half of employees ( 47 % ) will participate in screenings with no financial incentives at all .
If offered $ 100 to participate , the number goes up to 59 % of all employees , and when offered $ 200 the number goes up to 63 % .
Because doubling the incentive from $ 100 to $ 200 causes so little change in participation , researchers suggested companies can save money by changing the structure of their incentive programs .
Some employers began to cut back on wellness benefits in 2016 after human resources studies uncovered a lower return on investment for the programs than initially expected .
How the $ 3 trillion wellness industry confuses fact with fad Still , the programs have one measurable benefit , according to the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign study .
They make employees think their employers care about them .
Employees are increasingly expecting perks in the office , though not necessarily health - related ones .
Nearly one - quarter ( 23 % ) of employees told a 2018 Randstad survey that they would like to see more on - site lifestyle amenities like gyms and dry - cleaning at their workplaces .
They also overwhelmingly want free health care and paid time off .
Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign said their study does not discredit health programs , but rather show they are nt a quick pay - off . "
If a company expects to see savings in the first year , its unlikely , " he said . "
But workplace wellness programs may be a good way for a firm to offer additional benefits even if it does nt help their bottom line . "

Duchess Meghan of Sussex 's third outfit of the day on Tuesday was another stunner : A sleek black dress that looked perfect at a summer garden party in green Ireland , where she and Prince Harry are on their first official foreign trip as a royal couple .
Fresh from a day of royal and military celebrations in London , the Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived in Dublin Tuesday evening and plunged into a busy schedule that will continue Wednesday .
Their day culminated in a garden party at Glencairn House , the residence of the British ambassador to Ireland in Dublin , where the former Meghan Markle 's stylish dress stood out even after a day of stylish outfits . "
Were so pleased to be here for our first official international visit together as a married couple , and we hope it will be the first of many ! "
Harry declared in a speech at the party .
She was dressed on arrival in a dark green top and matching mid - length skirt with pockets by Givenchy .
Her hair was pulled back in an off - center low chignon and she carried a large cognac - colored bag by Strathberry .
Harry had changed from his military uniform into a smart suit with an olive green tie .
The palace tweeted a picture of their arrival in both English and Irish .
Meghan was n't wearing a hat or fascinator when she arrived at the airport but she was wearing nude suede high heels .
They were similar or the same ones she wore earlier in the day with a fit - and - flared dark Dior dress during celebrations of the centenary of the Royal Air Force .
The couple headed first to a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar , elected a year ago as Taoiseach , becoming Ireland 's youngest - ever prime minister and its first openly gay head of government .
Next they raised glasses at what Kensington Palace called a " Summer Party " at Glencairn House , where Harry delivered a warm speech , in English and some Irish , about the history of British - Irish relations .
For the occasion , Meghan let down her hair into loose curls and donned a cool sleeveless black dress by Emilia Wickstead with an sleek A - line silhouette , square neckline , midi length and a belt .
The weather looked good for a garden party , according to a British Embassy tweet .
In his speech at the party , Harry talked about the successful exchange of recent visits of royals and officials between the two countries , especially his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II 's historic state visit in May 2011 . "
As each others closest neighbors , the U.K. and Irelands relationship is unique ; our shared history is long and complex .
There have of course been challenging , and at times tragic , periods of that relationship , " Harry said , according to a palace transcript of his speech . "
On this visit we will also celebrate just how much unites us ... We share common values ; culture , business links , family ties , and possibly a similar sense of humor . "
He concluded by quoting from the traditional saying in Irish to the effect of " we live in each others shadows , " shielding each other and relying on each other for shelter . "
That sentiment is as apt now as it was then , as we draw strength from one another as neighbors , partners , and above all friends , " Harry said .
The Sussex itinerary over the next 24 hours includes receptions , sports and a meeting with Irish President Michael Higgins .
They are scheduled to see the historic Book of Kells in Trinity College 's famed Old Library , pay respects at the nearby memorial to the Irish Famine and explore the Irish Emigration Museum .
The palace has described their visit as an opportunity for the couple to meet the people of Dublin and visit organizations " central to Irish life . "
Since their May 19 wedding at Windsor Castle , Harry , 33 , and Meghan , 36 , a former actress , have appeared in public , solo and together , multiple times in Britain but this quick trip marks their international debut as representatives of his grandmother , Queen Elizabeth II , and at the request of her government .

Each week , USA TODAY 's OnPolitics blog takes a look at how media from the left and the right reacted to a political news story , giving liberals and conservatives a peek into the other 's media bubble .
This week , political pundits were divided over Judge Brett Kavanaugh , President Donald Trump 's nominee to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy .
Conservatives argued that Democrats were prepared to oppose anyone Trump nominated but that Kavanaugh is such a strong nominee that their efforts to block him are certain to fail .
Liberals said Kavanaugh would shift the court sharply to the right and that he would ensure a vote in Trump 's favor if issues tied to special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation ever came before the Supreme Court .
Previous bubble : Kennedy ensured legacy by retiring before midterms , conservatives say Conservative bubble : Democrats fear the Constitution , not Kavanaugh " Most Democrats were going to get hysterical about any pick , because any conservative pick was going to take the Constitution far too literally for their liking , " said The Federalist 's David Harsanyi . "
For those who rely on the administrative state and coercion as a policy tool - forcing people to join political organizations , forcing them to support abortion , forcing them to subsidize socially progressive sacraments , forcing them to create products that undermine their faith , and so on - that s a big problem , " he said .
It seems to me that with another originalist justice we inch closer to a time when the majority of the Left will simply dismiss the court as an antiquated impediment to progress .
More : Donald Trump plays it safe with Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh 's gold - plated resume Liberal bubble : Kavanaugh could provide cover for Trump " We have never had a nominee who was chosen by a president identified as the subject of a criminal inquiry , " and therefore Kavanaugh must indicate how he would rule on questions of executive authority and the Mueller investigation , wrote Caroline Fredrickson , the president of the American Constitution Society , and Norman L. Eisen , the Chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics , in a New York Times op - ed .
If the Senate confirms him without resolving these questions , we face the prospect of a new associate justice who poses a grave danger to the legitimacy of the court - and our democratic system of checks and balances .
Today 's talker : Brett Kavanaugh already misled Americans on important issues Conservative bubble : Charges of partisanship wo n't stick " Backed by an activist - fueled propaganda machine , " Senate Democrats are about to " unleash relentless personal attacks " on Kavanaugh , said David B. Rivkin Jr. and Andrew M. Grossman in The Wall Street Journal .
But the attacks " should be unavailing " Rivkin and Grossman said , calling Kavanaugh : " A champion of the Constitutions structural safeguards against overweening government . " "
The Democrats formulaic charges of partisanship wo nt stick " because he is committed to constitutional " textualism " as evidenced by a track record of frequently ruling against the government " across three successive administrations , " the legal experts wrote .
More : Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will face anti - Catholic bigotry -- yes , bigotry Liberal bubble : ' Kavanaugh could drastically shift the court to the right ' Kavanaugh 's nomination comes at a " tense moment , " said The Washington Post Editorial Board . "
It could drastically shift the courts tenuous ideological balance , and it comes not long after Senate Republicans disgracefully blocked President Barack Obama from making a court pick in his final year , " said the Post 's board . "
More than ever , the court is in danger of becoming viewed as an instrument of politics rather than an independent , nonpartisan branch of government . "
Trump " ignores traditional boundaries on presidential action and the Republican Party mostly enables his autocratic instincts , " the board said .
But , " Republicans should not duck their responsibility to bring a critical eye to the coming confirmation process . "
More : Supreme Court should leave Roe v. Wade alone -- for freedom 's sake Conservative bubble : Fear mongering reaches new levels Since Kavanaugh was named as Trump 's nominee the oppostion from liberals " has only become increasingly hostile and emotional , " wrote Katie Pavlich for The Hill . "
In the aftermath of an official announcement , the fear mongering has been ratcheted up to new levels , complete with accusations of millions of lives being threatened if Kavanaugh is confirmed . "
Politically , opposing Kavanaugh for the sake of the resistance is the wrong fight for Democrats to take on before the 2018 midterm elections .
Conservatives and Republicans are mobilized in far greater numbers than Democrats on this issue .
President Trump nominated Kavanaugh because he qualified to sit on Americas highest court .
His 300 opinions over the past 12 years prove it and Democrats would serve the country well by focusing on substance , rather than emotion , as we move forward with the confirmation process .
Judge Kavanaugh 's clerk : He was a wonderful boss and a fair - minded judge Liberal bubble : Supreme Court may finally become a driving issue for Democrats It is unlikely the Republican - controlled Senate will fail to confirm Kavanaugh because " filling the nations courts with conservative justices is a unifying principle for the Republican Party and appears to be the one sacred cow that even Trump wo nt slaughter , " said The New Republic 's Matt Ford .
But Ford is optimistic that Kavanaugh 's confirmation could finally make the Supreme Court a major issue for the Democratic base : The conservative movements push to remake the courts since the 1970s and 1980s ultimately sprang from the Warren Courts spree of liberal decisions in the 1950s and 1960s .
Now that conservatives firmly control the courts direction , their rulings may prompt a similar pushback from liberals in the years to come .
Mondays announcement may ultimately mark not just the culmination of one campaign for control of the nations judiciary , but the beginning of another .

Economist : Volatility in Asian markets will increase significantly Rainer Michael Preiss , executive director at Taurus Wealth Advisors , discusses potential risks for investors in Chinese markets .
Economists at the largest bond fund manager in the world predict the Federal Reserve would hint at a respite for its rate - hike cycle once the yield curve inverts , a phenomenon that has preceded every recession since World War II .
That s according to Joachim Fels , global economic adviser for Pimco , who says once short - term yields push above their long - term peers , the inflection point would send shivers through the bond market and all across Wall Street amid concerns the Fed could prematurely end the second longest economic expansion in the U.S.s post - war history .
Triggering a one - two punch of a selloff in risky assets and tighter credit conditions , the inverted curve would force the central bank to " change gears and signal a pause in the hiking cycle to avoid a lasting curve inversion , " said Fels .
The yield curve would thus " become part of the Feds reaction function . "
Fels measures the yield curve through the spread between the 3-month London interbank offered rate , a benchmark for trillions of floating - rate loans , and the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.435 % .
By this gauge , the curve could invert by the end of this year if the central bank raises rates two more times this year , as a slight majority on the Fed panel has signaled , and the 10-year yield does nt budge from current levels , Fels said .
Read:5 key ways Wall Street and economists think about the yield curve The Feds push to raise rates at a gradual pace has lifted short - term yields while the long end has nt significantly built in its own inflation risks , at least not at the same clip .
The result is a flatter curve .
The yield spread between the 3-month Libor rate and the 10-year note currently stands at around 50 basis points .
On the more popular measure of curves slope , the yield gap between the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.579 % and the 10-year note sits at a much narrower 24.3 basis points .
With the strong growth outlook compelling the central bank to raise rates , investors have suggested the only reason the central bank might pause its tightening cycle in the near future could be a yield curve inversion .
At the same time , market participants say the central bank would be wary of showing too much deference to the yield curve , at the expense of their own staff economists models and forecasts , said Tom Graff , head of fixed income at Brown Advisory .
Opinion : The bond market goes its own way Yet senior Fed officials have made repeated references to the bond market indicator in the last few weeks , hinting at a nervousness in the central banks ranks over the curves predictive powers .
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic , St. Louis Fed President James Bullard , Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari have all said at one time or another that the central bank should avoid trying to invert the yield curve .
Read : Yield curves return to flattest levels in decade raises question over its significance So far , the most important person at the Fed seems unwilling to back down .
Chairman Fed Powell in his testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday deflected questions about whether the central bank would blink in the face of the yield curves nearing an inversion .
Powell said he saw the inverted curve as a reflection of the long - term neutral rates , the theoretical level at which monetary policy neither stimulates or slows the economy .

Eighth Grade ' trailer takes us way , way back Written and directed by Bo Burnham , " Eighth Grade " explores the awkward years we all wish we could forget .
EL PASO , Texas -- A little boy with a wooden toy guitar walked knee high next to his father , one family among three undocumented migrant dads reunited and released with their young children here .
The joyful reunion Tuesday night occurred on the deadline a federal court set for the reunification of so - called tender - age immigrant children with their parents .
The two boys and a girl , who appeared to be about 3 or 4 years old , are staying with their dads at the Casa Vides shelter downtown . "
Feliz , muy feliz , " one dad responded when a shelter worker asked how he felt , saying he was very happy .
The children quickly found toys inside the shelter .
> July 10 : Judge will not extend deadlines for Trump administration to reunite families > July 10:34 children to be reunited with parents ; no timetable for other migrants One boy played with plush animals and a toy farmhouse that made animal noises .
The girl grabbed a doll with a pink dress .
The other boy played with a headless Buzz Lightyear doll , telling his father that he was hungry before getting a cup of apple sauce .
The dads were reunited with their kids at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in El Paso before being released to the shelter , said Director Ruben Garcia of Annunciation House , which operates Casa Vides .

The parents and children arrived at Casa Vides at about 8:30 p.m. in a government van .
They carried a few bags , including cloth Walmart bags .
Because of the separation , Garcia said he was worried how the kids arriving Tuesday evening would react .
Some of those concerns melted away after he saw how happy the children were with their dads . "
There was a just a genuine union between parent and child , " Garcia said , describing the arrival of fathers and children at the shelter .
One of the boys had a big smile , came up to him , told him his name and gave him a handshake , Garcia said . "
You are safe here , " Garcia told the men in Spanish after they entered the shelter .
The dads told Garcia that they had little notice that they were being released from a immigrant detention facility near El Paso .
It was not immediately available how long they had been separated from their children .
One man mentioned he was from Honduras .
The home countries of the other two men were not disclosed .
The stress and emotion of the situation could be heard in the voices of the men as they spoke with Garcia .
One man told Garcia that the U.S. Border Patrol treated him like he was nothing . "
Who do you think you are ?
What gives you the right to come illegally into my country ? "
one agent told the migrant .

The three dads did n't attend the news conference outside .
Garcia said he was thankful for the reunification of the three fathers but said 1,000 to possibly 1,500 parents " who tonight will sleep in an immigration detention center " away from their children .

Those immigrants were from El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras .
Most of those immigrants have gone on to the homes of their sponsors in different parts of the U.S. They must still appear before immigration authorities .

Elon Musk has apologized for a vicious attack on a British diver who helped rescue a group of boys from a Thai cave , saying his words were " spoken in anger . "
Over the weekend , the Tesla Inc. TSLA , -4.35 % CEO branded Vern Unsworth a " pedo , " or pedophile , after the diving expert criticized Musks bid to help the rescue by sending in a mini - submarine .
Unsworth described Musks offer as a PR stunt that had no chance of working .
Elon Musk launched a vicious Twitter attack Sunday against one of the divers who helped rescue a group of boys from a Thai cave last week , calling him a " pedo " after the diver criticized the Tesla TSLA , -4.35 % chiefs failed bid to aid the situation .
Vern Unsworth - who was on the international team of specialist cave divers at the scene - had told CNN that he thought the mini - submarine the Tesla chief sent to help with the rescue was a useless grab for attention .
See also : Elon Musk says he will fund water filters for homes in Flint , Michigan Unsworth said Musks mini - sub stunt , in fact , got in the way of the rescue . "
It just had absolutely no chance of working .
He had no conception of what the cave passage was like .
The submarine I believe was about 5 feet , 6 inches long , rigid , so it would nt have gone round corners or round any obstacles , " Unsworth said . "
It would nt have made the first 50 metres into the cave from the dive start point .
It was just a PR stunt . "
Unsworth said Musk was asked to leave the cave , as " he should have been . "
Musk then tweeted of Unsworth : " Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand ( sus ) at any point when we were in the caves . "
Only people in sight were the Thai navy / army guys , who were great .
Thai navy seals escorted us in -- total opposite of wanting us to leave . "
Water level was actually very low & still ( not flowing ) -- you could literally have swum to Cave 5 with no gear , which is obv how the kids got in .
If not true , then I challenge this dude to show final rescue video .
Huge credit to pump & generator team .
Unsung heroes here , " Musk added . "
You know what , do nt bother showing the video , " Musk wrote . "
We will make one of the mini - sub / pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo .
Sorry pedo guy , you really did ask for it . "
During the rescue , Musk had tweeted about his idea to help .
This story was originally published on NYPost.com .
Elon Musk to send team of engineers to assist Thai cave rescue mission Tesla founder Elon Musk said on Twitter that engineers from SpaceX and The Boring Company would travel to Thailand on Saturday .
Technicians could pump water through the cave and provide battery packs to provide electricity to boost the pump rate , Musk said .
He also raised the possibility of a nylon tube being inserted into the cave to inflate it with air " like a bouncy castle . "
Embassy to Americans : ' Keep low profile ' in London during Trump visit Americans in Britain were asked to keep a low profile during President Trumps visit .
Veuer 's Sam Berman has the full story .
Emin Agalarov , a Russian real estate developer and pop singer who helped set up Donald Trump Jr. 's infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting , spoke for the first time about allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians trying to influence the election .
In an interview with " Vice News Tonight " that aired Tuesday on HBO , Agalarov dismissed the idea that he took part in meddling in the American presidential election as " ridiculous " and denied sending prostitutes to Donald Trump 's hotel room during a 2013 trip to Moscow . "
I have been accused of influencing -- this is gon na sound very strange -- influencing the American election .
Me , this guy here from Azerbaijan , living in Moscow .
Because I know personally Mr. Donald Trump , " Agalarov told Vice . "
Its quite a strange and ridiculous accusation . "
Agalarov admitted to Vice that he helped set up the June 9 , 2016 , meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between Trump Jr. and Natalia Veselnitskaya , a Russian lawyer with Kremlin ties .
President Donald Trump 's son in law Jared Kushner and then Trump - campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting .
Agalarov denied knowing Veselnitskaya .
He said his father was acquainted with her and that he helped set up the Trump Tower meeting at his father 's request . "
I think somebody asked him to help her set that meeting knowing that we were acquainted with the Trump family , " Agalarov told Vice .
He said he did not know who asked his father to arrange the meeting .
The Russian musician did say he spoke to Trump Jr. before the meeting .
Agalarov said he told Trump Jr. , " There 's some people that want to meet you . "
Trump and Russia : A timeline of the investigation More : Trump Jr. told investigators he ca n't recall if he discussed Russian meeting with his father " They obviously want something that could potentially help them resolve things that you could be interested in or maybe not , " Agalarov said he told Trump Jr. " If you can spare a few minutes of your time , I 'd be grateful .
If not , no problem . "
According to Agalarov , Trump Jr. said , " Of course .
I 'll do it if you 're asking . "
As for the email from publicist Rob Goldstone to Trump Jr. that said Veselnitskaya would have " dirt " on Hillary Clinton , Agalarov said Goldstone was exaggerating to gain favor with the Trumps .
Agalarov also addressed an account from former Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller about a man who offered to send five prostitutes to Trump 's room during a 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant .
According to The Washington Post , Schiller testified to the House Intelligence Committee in November that a man who appeared Russian or Ukranian made the offer at the end of a meeting with about 15 people to discuss the pageant . "
No , man , we 're not interested , " Schiller told the man .
He also said he and Trump later joked about the offer .
Agalarov denied making the offer or knowing anything about it . "
Mr. Trump came to Moscow with 87 of the most beautiful ladies in the world , " Agalarov told Vice . "
I would never even offer it because I can never live up to the high level of the most amazing and beautiful women surrounding us constantly . "
Algaraov released a video last month for his song " Got Me Good " in which he mocked the scandal around him , Trump and the 2016 election .

Emojis have become part and parcel of how we communicate with friends and families .
We do nt think twice when sending a smiley or frowney face to those with whom we are closest .
These cute images add emotion , humor , and meaning to messages .
They are the spice in otherwise bland text - based communication .
But when it comes to writing emails to colleagues , its not such a good idea to use emojis .
When you add a smiley emoji to a message , your recipient may not see you as warmer or more optimistic .
Rather , you might be sending the message that you are nt serious or competent .
In a recent study , researchers found those who read messages with smiley emojis rated the senders as less competent . "
Perceptions of low competence in turn undermined information sharing , " conclude the authors of the study .
Yet 76 percent of Americans use emojis such as a happy face , thumbs up , and winking face in their professional communications .
Here are a few times when it might be a good idea to use emojis in work emails :
Entry sign for John Glenn Astronomy Park Source : Brad Hoehne | John Glenn Astronomy Park Barely a week ago , Ohio threw open the doors to the John Glenn Astronomy Park , christened after the former astronaut and American icon .
Glenns four - acre namesake opened last week in Hocking Hills , about 40 miles southeast of Columbus , the Buckeye States capital .
The 10,000 acres of surrounding forest is considered rare air for astronomy buffs , because of its lack of light pollution that makes it easier to get unusually clear night views of star - filled skies .
Southeast Ohios Hocking Hills is one of the rare dark sky regions in the U.S. Source : Aaron Rigsby The former U.S. senator and Ohio native -- the first American to orbit the earth -- gave his blessing to the astronomy park shortly before his death in December 2016 .
CNBC recently got a look at some of the attractions inside the new park .
Salute to an Ohio hero Astronaut John Glenn Source : NASA The astronomy park functions as a something of a love letter to both space and Glenn , who died at the age of 95 after an illustrious career .
Glenns connection with space and the stars likely started when he was very young boy : A recent estate sale of items that belonged to Glenn as a child included a pillowcase embroidered with stars , revolving planets and spacecraft bearing the name " John " in blue letters .
Solar Plaza Source : Brad Hoehne | John Glenn Astronomy Park The park opened to the public on June 21 - the summer solstice and the longest day of the year .
It features an enclosed 540-square - foot observatory with a retractable roof , as well an 80-foot in diameter Solar Plaza .
The low wall that encircles the plaza is notched to offer framed views of the sun on key days , and a standing sundial allows visitors to see the Suns movement . '

Camping is nt permitted , but the Plaza area will be open to the public , for free , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week .
The website tells visitors : " If you ve got the stamina to stay up all night , there s nothing to keep you from enjoying the sky all night long . "

In a statement marking the opening of the park , Karen Raymore , the Hocking Hills Tourism Association executive director said she was " thrilled to offer one more reason for travelers to visit the region , and a new way for them to experience a natural attraction that has long mesmerized all who visit us overnight .

Erica Payne Opinion contributor Last month 's upset primary victory by Alexandria Ocasio - Cortez , who beat 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in a New York City district , was decisive proof : the Democrats path to victory requires exciting their base with a bold , fearless agenda that includes Medicare for all .
We have seen this strategy prove successful not just for Ocasio - Cortez , but also for Ben Jealous , who won a competitive primary for Maryland governor , and candidates like Kara Eastman , who won her primary against a former congressman in Nebraska .
The merits of Medicare for all have been touted by medical professionals , business leaders and health care economists for a variety of reasons : it would help drive down costs , eliminate administrative waste , increase transparency , bring down rising drug costs , and ease the costly burden of health insurance from businesses and individuals .
And , beyond the benefits of the policy , its a winning political strategy .
It 's not enough to fix ACA Despite Democrats ' attempts to salvage the Affordable Care Act -- a crucial law for millions of Americans -- sabotage by the Trump administration and Republicans has proved highly effective .
They ve cut advertising budgets aimed at getting more young people into the insurance pool , repealed the individual mandate which helped balance out healthy and sick people , announced they wo nt defend protections against price gouging for people with pre - existing conditions , and just froze billions of dollars in payments meant to help insurers cover sicker policyholders .
As a result , the uninsured rate rose last year for the first time since the bill was enacted in 2010 -- 12.2 % of Americans are now uninsured .
While the ACA has managed to slow the rate of premium increases , they are still rising faster than wages and the inflation rate .
More : Health care will define the midterms .
Donald Trump 's move to gut Obamacare guarantees it .
I still want to work with Republicans to fix health care and lower costs : Patty Murray Mental health crisis is n't about guns .
It 's about Trump & GOP gutting Medicaid : Kennedy To win , Democrats need to do more than just point fingers at Republicans and claim they re destroying the ACA .
Candidates need to take it one step further : Make Medicare for all a central part of their platform .
This message draws a clear line in the sand : Republicans want to strip you of your health insurance , while Democrats want to offer low - cost , universal coverage .
Its an endorsement of universal health care that does nt waffle , and is nt complicated .
Unlike the Affordable Care Act , Medicare for all is not difficult to understand , and sells itself on its merits .
It appeals to patients drowning in medical debt , doctors and medical professionals buried in paperwork , workers who are shouldering more of their premium costs , and business owners who year after year are forced to devote more resources to keeping their employees insured .
It excites a group that Democrats desperately need to get to the polls -- younger voters , who strongly support it .. And it shows that a candidate is willing to take on special interests on behalf of their constituents .
Medicare for all is a better insurance system Voters want to hear a positive message around health care : recent polling data revealed that preserving health care is the top voting issue for Americans .
Democrats can be the party offering a bold and viable solution .
They need to tell voters how they re going to make things better , how they re going to defend health care as a basic right , and how they re going to create a new system that better serves the needs of patients , workers , small and mid - sized businesses , and the economy .
They need to really differentiate themselves from the Republicans and show that they speak for people first , not the insurance and pharmaceutical industries .
Medicare for All is more than just the right thing to do , and its more than just good policy .
Its good politics .

EVANSVILLE , Ind. -- A youth baseball game at the Scott Township Baseball Fields Sunday experienced a different ending than planned after the final at - bat of the game .
Gregory VanBibber , 44 , was charged with battery , a Class A misdemeanor , after an altercation with the umpire calling the game behind home plate following a called ball four .
According to the probable cause affidavit , the Vanderburgh County Sheriffs Office was called to the baseball field around 5:12 p.m. in reference to a fight between an umpire and VanBibber , an assistant baseball coach with the 14u Eagles Travel Baseball team , which was playing during the call .
Rickey Cassitty , the umpire , had called the game due to the time limit being reached .
The Eagles head coach came out of the dugout to question him for ending the game .
What occurred next differs between the two parties .
Cassitty told officers VanBibber had been yelling from the dugout about the way he was calling balls and strikes .
As Cassitty was talking with the head coach , VanBibber came charging out of the dugout and tackled him to the ground .
Cassitty said VanBibber drew his arm back in an attempt to punch him , but by that time the two had been separated . "
This was basically a charity event , " Cassitty told the Courier & Press . "
I was asked to umpire some games , and I graciously did .
I made a high ball three call , and ( VanBibber ) started cussing from the dugout .
I had called for time and told the gentleman to watch his language .
I got back behind the plate and called a ball four .
My partner then said that time was over . "
The kids walked on the field to shake hands .
I had another coach saying that I was yelling at him .
I told him that I was referring to the gentleman cussing in the dugout .
The next thing I know , I am on my back . "
The games score was 15 - 6 , according to Cassitty , with an Eagles loss .
Cassitty told police he had pain in his right hip where he previously had a hip replacement and scratches on his left elbow .
VanBibber had a different account of the events , according to the affidavit .
He said he was upset about the way Cassitty ended the game and admitted to saying " damn " after one call .
After complying with a request from Cassitty to be quiet , VanBibber told the arresting deputy sheriff that he heard Cassitty tell the head coach he ended the game because of the profanity .
The assistant coach approached the umpire to confront him and that Cassitty " stepped toward him causing the two to bump each other . "
Cassitty then fell to the ground .
VanBibber called it an accident and denied attempting to hit Cassitty .
One witness told police he witnessed VanBibber walking out of the dugout in an aggressive manner and chest bumped Cassitty .
Others then pulled the coach away from the umpire .
VanBibber could not be reached for a comment .
Eagles program director Kevin Brown told the Courier & Press he was notified of the incident last night .
He said VanBibber has been relieved of his coaching duties with the team .

Even if this is only Summer League , any indication of what New York Knicks rookie Kevin Knox could potentially do during the regular season is going to draw attention .
So the athleticism that he 's shown , the high - flying dunks he 's slammed through the rim , the drives he 's made to the basket and the three - point shots he 's drained will send a jolt of excitement through a Knicks fan base searching for something to give it hope for a brighter future .
Through three games , Knox has impressed .
He did again on Tuesday night by scoring 29 points on 9-of-22 shooting in a 109 - 92 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers at Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas .
Sixteen of his points came in the third quarter , helping the Knicks erase a 25-point deficit .
Knox , who also grabbed nine rebounds , connected on five of his seven - three - point attempts , an area of his game that he had struggled with in the Knicks ' first two Summer League contests .
Knox , the Knicks ' ninth - overall pick in the draft , has made a big impression early , averaging 23.3 points through three games .
The key word is " early . "
Even general manager Scott Perry downplayed Summer League performances , telling reporters before the game that drawing conclusions would be premature . "
You have to measure Summer League - the excitement or the disappointment , it is what it is : Its Summer League basketball , " Perry said . "
Do we see some encouraging things from some guys ?
Yes , " Perry told reporters Tuesday in Las Vegas . "
But we know the guys they re playing against are not the same guys they re playing against in the fall . "
Still , Knox , 18 , has played with a confidence , poise and maturity beyond his years .
At this point , he does n't seem overwhelmed .
There 's a long way from Summer League games in Las Vegas to the regular season .
In the meantime , the Knicks and their fans can only hope that Knox 's recent performances are a sign of what 's to come .
Noah update Perry was asked by reporters where the team stands with Joakim Noah , and the GM said the center is still part of the team . "
And as I said earlier before all options are on the table for us concerning him , " Perry said . "
Whether that means him coming back or if there 's some sort of trade or whatever the case may be , so he 's still a member of the Knicks right now . "
Schedule The Knicks will begin the tournament stage of Summer League against the Boston Celtics on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. The game will be televised on ESPN 2 .

Facebook co - founder Chris Hughes thinks the government should give cash handouts to people with the lowest incomes in order to fight income inequality .
And he thinks the money should come from higher taxes on wealthy individuals and even big tech companies , like Facebook .
Hughes , 34 , was one of Facebooks co - founders , along with Mark Zuckerberg and three of their Harvard classmates , in 2004 .
He was Facebooks spokesperson for the companys first three years , before leaving to finish his Harvard degree and then to work on Barack Obamas 2008 presidential campaign as a media strategist .
He says he 's made " half a billion dollars for three years of work " based on the value of his initial stock in Facebook , and his " lucky break " is exactly what 's wrong with America today . "
That is indicative of a fundamental unfairness in our economy .
Income inequality in our country has not been this bad since the Great Depression .
And even though were reading the headlines that unemployment is at 3.9 percent and the stock market is at record highs , what s actually happening is that the median incomes in our country have nt budged in nearly 40 years .
At the same time stories like mine create an illusion of economic opportunity , " he told Techcrunch contributors Adriana Stan and Tom Goodwin on their " Interesting People in Interesting Times " podcast .
Hughes , author of " Fair Shot : Rethinking Inequality and How We Earn , " is not necessarily a believer in the idea of universal basic income ( UBI ) -- championed by entrepreneur Andrew Yang and also supported by billionaires such as Richard Branson and -- which would see a standard cash payment handed out to all citizens no matter their employment status .
UBI " is infeasible in America today , " Hughes explained on the podcast , because making payments to everyone in the U.S. is an " unaffordable " proposition .
However , Hughes believes a reconfigured U.S. tax code could effectively transfer money from wealthy people like himself to those in need , from the unemployed to American workers struggling to make ends meet .
He says on the podcast that the " most urgent thing we can do " is roll back tax code changes that lowered rates on corporations and the 1 percent and instead give a $ 500 monthly tax credit to every working American who currently earns less than $ 50,000 per year to create an " income floor " -- a minimum amount of money that people earn .

FCC commissioner Ajit Pai said in a statement Monday morning that he has " serious concerns " about the Sinclair Broadcast Group 's SBGI , -2.31 % acquisition of Tribune Media Co. TRCO , citing deals Sinclair has made to divest its TV stations prior to the deal 's close . "
The evidence we 've received suggests that certain station divestitures that have been proposed to the FCC would allow Sinclair to control those stations in practice , even if not in name , in violation of the law , " Pai said in a statement posted to Twitter . "
When the FCC confronts disputed issues like these , the Communications Act does not allow it to approve a transaction , " he said .
Pai recommended the merger be sent to an administrative law judge for review , saying that " the law requires the FCC to designate the transaction for a hearing in order to get to the bottom of those disputed issues .
For these reasons , I have shared with my colleagues a draft order that would designate issues involving certain proposed divestitures for a hearing in front of an administrative law judge . "

Financials are staging a rebound after posting five straight months of losses , and a top technician says there s one name in the group that looks like a safe bet into earnings season .
Financials were surging Monday , with the XLF ETF that tracks the space jumping 2 percent .
Despite the gains , financials are still down more than 2 percent this year as the threat of the flattening yield curve has put pressure on the rate - sensitive sector .
However according to Carter Worth , head of technical analysis at Cornerstone Macro , there s something in the charts signaling big gains ahead for Dow component American Express .
The stock has soared more than 18 percent in the last 12 months , more than doubling that of the broader financials sector which is up just 8 percent in the same time period .
Despite the run - up , American Express is still down 3 percent from its May high of $ 103.24 .
However Worths charting reveals that shares of AmEx are inching closer to its upward trendline where the stock has recurrently bounced higher from . "
I think is a very important stock obviously , and its a stock that I want to be in in an area that s not good , " Worth said Friday on CNBCs " Options Action . "
Its been a tough year for the financials , now down 10 percent from their 52-week high of $ 30.17 and recently posting five straight months of losses -- an occurrence that s only happened five times in its trading history .
According to Worths analysis , this rare pattern of declines have often been followed by more pain in the weeks to come . "
The odds of [ financials ] being down are pretty high , " Worth said . "
Its a bad area of the market .
I think at this point that s pretty clear . "
Nonetheless , Worths analysis illustrates that relative to the lagging financials sector , shares of American Express have created a bullish cup - and - handle formation indicating a " perspective break out " ahead for shares of the credit card company .
Moreover , Worth draws attention to the general outperformance of American Express .
The stock is up 63 percent since 2016 , compared to a 46 percent gain in the financial sector and 30 percent gain in the . " [
American Express ] looks like its in fact going to break out and go higher .
I think this is a place to be if you need to be in a financials now , " he said .
Shares of American Express were trading higher Monday afternoon , around $ 99.91

Following a ninth - inning meltdown in which he gave up three runs without getting an out , the Houston Astros have sent former closer Ken Giles to the minors .
While his 4.99 ERA might be reason enough for the demotion , the way he left Tuesday 's game against Oakland might also have been a contributing factor .
Television replays appeared to show Giles using an expletive when manager A.J. Hinch came out to replace him in a game the Astros eventually won 6 - 5 in 11 innings .
In Hinch 's pregame media session on Wednesday , he declined to comment on the interaction he had with Giles the night before . "
We deal with a lot of different things behind the scenes internally as a team , " he told reporters . "
Let 's keep it to baseball . "
After recording 34 saves and posting a 2.30 ERA in 2017 , Giles lost his closer job during the Astros ' World Series triumph and has been inconsistent this season .
Although he has n't officially blown a save in 12 chances -- he entered Tuesday 's game with a four - run lead -- the Astros have also turned to Hector Rondon ( 7 saves ) , Chris Devenski ( 2 ) and Brad Peacock ( 2 ) in save situations . "
He 's not right , " Hinch said about Giles . "
We need to get him right mentally and physically to make sure he 's a good contributor to our pen . "

For all the frightening headlines of trade wars , rising interest rates and overheated stock markets , the broad indexes are all up for 2018 .
But there are always stocks that are down significantly , and screening the worst performers can highlight potential bargains .
Looking at the S&P 1500 Composite Index ( comprising the S&P 500 US : SPX , the S&P 400 Mid Cap Index US : MID and the S&P 600 Small Cap Index US : SML ) , 104 stocks had plummeted at least 20 % , including reinvested dividends , for 2018 through July 6 .
Narrowing the list further , 81 of those companies had increased their sales per share for the most recently reported 12-month period from the year - earlier 12-month period and 29 had improved their gross profit margins at the same time .
Of those , 17 also improved their sales per share and gross margins for their most recently reported quarters from a year earlier .
That could signal investors have been overreacting and that there are opportunities for bottom - fishers .
At many of these companies , shares have pulled back following major gains in 2017 .

If you are interested in considering any of these companies for long - term investments following their significant declines this year , you need to do your own research to determine whether you believe the price pullbacks are only temporary setbacks to otherwise healthy prospects for continued success against competitors over the next decade , or whether the declines signal something deeper .
For Dana Whites Contender Series 12 winner Bevon Lewis , picking up a UFC contract on Tuesday was really no different than heading down to FedEx to pick up a package .
He had to take a businesslike approach to the fight , which streamed on UFC Fight Pass from The Ultimate Fighter Gym in Las Vegas .
Lewis was one of two fighters who received a UFC deal .
Lewis ( 6 - 0 ) knocked fellow middleweight Alton Cunningham ( 3 - 1 ) from the unbeaten ranks with a first - round TKO win .
It was his second DWCS victory - he scored a TKO win over Elias Urbina at DWCS 8 in 2017 - and moved him to 6 - 0 with three knockouts since his 2015 pro debut .
He had some nerves and uncertainty for his first DWCS bout a year ago , but the second time around , he was determined to claim what was his : a UFC deal . "
The point of getting to this year , well , we planned on it , so its pretty much like going to pick up a package , " he told MMAjunkie .
All things considered , he said things played out like they should ve .
As soon as he considered taking a DWCS bout and possibly earning a UFC contract , he prepared himself for fighting the divisions elite .
In 2017 , that was well - traveled vet Gegard Mousasi , who s now with Bellator but still serves as a sort of measuring stick for Lewis . "
I probably was nt even ready , " he said of his first DWCS win and lack of a UFC contract . "
The first thing that came to my mind was like , ' Yo , what if that was Mousasi or something ? ...
It was a hard pill to swallow , but I understood . "
With Mousasi out of the picture , Lewis is still focused on the divisions elite .
If his career plays out the way he plans , the 27-year - old LFA vet is going to have to fight them all anyway .
Its one reason he was already talking about recent UFC main - event winner and undefeated contender Israel Adesanya ( 14 - 0 MMA , 3 - 0 UFC ) - both his adoration for his style and the possibility of a future matchup - after this win ( via Twitter ) : But before he gets there , Lewis has one simple plan . "
I want to jump in right away , and I want to take some time ( off ) , " he said . "
I m not talking about vacation or nothing like that .
I m talking about just getting better .
I ve got to get better .
I ve got to keep feeling the pressure I ve been feeling . "
As for the future , he s ready for it all . "
Were fighting everybody , " he said . "
You ve got to . "

For renters who want to own their homes one day , the journey to build up enough savings for a down payment will be a long one .
A new report from Zillow Z , -2.34 % subsidiary HotPads , a rental search website , looked at the average renter nationwide to see how long it would take them to build a down payment .
If they earned the national median income ( $ 56,784 per year ) and saved 20 % of their income each month to put toward a down payment , it would take 77 months ( or nearly 6.5 years ) to build a 20 % down payment for a median - value home ( $ 216,000 ) .
Forequarter restaurant in Madison , Wisconsin , has managed to pull off a rare feat .
Not only has it has stayed in business for six years , it is also still routinely referred to as trendy .
On a recent visit , people were already showing up for dinner by 5:00 p.m. on a weeknight .
Business is good , said owner Jonny Hunter , but it could be so much better .
Getty Images " Were not open as much as we want to , " he said .
The restaurant is open only for dinner , and it is closed on Sundays .
Hunter said he would love to do more , if only he could staff the place . "
I think we would do brunch .
We might see some lunch service happening and maybe some breakfast , too , " he said . "
The idea of trying to open more services here -- you know , we ca nt even hardly staff our dinner service . "
Like so many employers across the country , the Forequarter is stuck in what experts call the skills gap -- businesses unable to fill skilled positions .
And make no mistake , Hunter said , working in the kitchen at a gourmet restaurant takes specialized skills . "
Your cooks need to be able to execute a fine - dining dish in a fairly quick amount of time , and those skills do nt come to you necessarily in a week or a month , " he said .
Jonny Hunter , owner of Forequarter restaurant in Madison , Wisconsin CNBC | Betsy Spring The skills gap has been around for a while .
It helps explain why , for the last four years , Workforce has been the most heavily weighted category in CNBCs Americas Top States for Business study .
Employers are clamoring for talent , and states are touting their people .
A recent survey of the CNBC , which represents a cross - section of public and private companies , found that roughly 83 percent of respondents said their company has had trouble finding qualified workers to fill skilled positions .
And lately the skills gap is getting worse , thanks to historically low unemployment -- 4 percent nationwide in June .
Now it is not just the skilled workers who are in short supply .
It is workers , period .
The shortage has some states going to extremes to attract workers .
to people willing to move to the state and work remotely in their current job .
Indiana has set up a web portal to attract veterans as they leave the military .
In North Platte , Nebraska , the local Chamber of Commerce is offering to match employers signing bonuses up to $ 5,000 .
If you build it , will they come ?
In Wisconsin the situation is bordering on desperate .
Unemployment in May hit a new record low of 2.8 percent .
That is among the lowest rates in the nation , and it comes before hiring begins at the giant .
The Taiwanese manufacturer has promised to hire as many as 13,000 people to build giant video displays in exchange for $ 4.5 billion in state and local incentives .
But it is not entirely clear where it will find those workers .
Terry Gou , chairman of Foxconn Technology Group , at an event in Racine , Wisconsin , on Nov. 10 , 2017 .
In exchange for $ 4.5 billion in state and local tax incentives , the electronics giant is building a massive manufacturing campus in Mt. Pleasant , Wisconsin .
Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images " Foxconn is currently developing recruitment plans for our Wisconsin operations in close consultation with relevant government agencies and stakeholders , " the company told CNBC in a statement .
The company would not say whether the worker shortage is affecting plans for the $ 10 billion project . "
We will announce plans and related timelines in accordance with different phases of project development , " the statement said .
Foxconn also said it believes it will be able to attract workers to Wisconsin with competitive wages and benefits , as well as the lure of working in a cutting - edge facility . "
Foxconn offers competitive remuneration packages for employees at all levels and provides a positive working environment to attract , develop and retain the best talent -- from right here in Wisconsin , the Midwest , and all across America , " the company said .
For its part , the state has taken the position that workers will be naturally drawn not only to the facility but to the tech community it hopes to develop around it , which the state has dubbed Wisconn Valley .
But officials are not leaving the issue to chance .
Foxconn CEO Terry Gou and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker talk before the groundbreaking of the 1,000-acre Foxconn Technology Group liquid - crystal display panel factory on June 28 , 2018 , in Mount Pleasant , Wisconsin .
Under the deal negotiated by Walker , Foxconn said it would build a $ 10 billion manufacturing complex that President Donald Trump called " the eighth wonder of the world . "
Andy Manis | Getty Images " As companies continue to grow , we want to make sure they have the people that they need in order to be successful , " said Tricia Braun , chief operating officer of Wisconsin Economic Development , the states business development arm . "
So when we are talking now about a 2.8 percent unemployment , we have to really think about where we can get more workers from . "
The agency is looking to all corners of the state , including rural areas in Northern Wisconsin , where unemployment is higher .
And it is targeting all walks of life . "
Were really trying to eliminate that skills gap .
Investments in our K-12 schools , to technical colleges , to even putting training facilities into our correctional institutions , " she said .
Gov. Scott Walker has pointed to increased funding of education , though the state lags much of the nation in that regard .
Wisconsin ranks 21st in the nation in per - pupil spending in public schools , according to statistics compiled by the National Education Association .
Crossing state lines
Former Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Adam " Pacman " Jones was involved in an altercation at the Atlanta airport on Tuesday night , according to police .
The fight left Jones , who is currently a free agent , with a laceration on his face and resulted in the arrest of airport employee Frank Ragin , who " was determined to be the primary aggressor , " according to an incident summary report from the Atlanta Police Department .
Police said the fight took place near Gate B6 at Hartsfield - Jackson International Airport after Ragin , who works for facility - management company ABM , made some sort of gesture toward Jones .
The two exchanged words until Ragin " struck Mr. Jones with a closed fist , " according to police .
A video of the altercation obtained by TMZ Sports and published Wednesday shows Jones and Ragin then squaring up toward one another as a woman tries to separate them .
A series of punches follows , and Ragin lands on the ground .
Police have initially determined that Jones was defending himself . "
During the course of the incident Mr. Ragin also struck a companion of Mr. Jones , causing an injury to her hand , " Atlanta police said in the incident summary . "
Mr. Ragin was determined to be the primary aggressor and was taken into custody .
He was charged with two counts of battery . "
Jones and the woman both declined medical treatment , according to police , while Ragin was transported to a local hospital .
Jones is still a free agent after the Bengals chose not to pick up the team option on his contract earlier this offseason .
He was infamously arrested in January 2017 and eventually suspended one game by the league for an incident with police in downtown Cincinnati .

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was arrested on Tuesday , three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters , amid an investigation into how billions of dollars went missing from a state fund he founded almost a decade ago .
Authorities picked up Najib from his home after serving him with a remand order , two sources close to the family said .
One of the sources said Najib was expected to be charged in court on Wednesday .
Malaysia 's anti - graft agency also said Najib had been arrested , according to state news agency Bernama .
A Najib spokesman did not immediately have a comment .
Najib has consistently denied wrongdoing in dealings with state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad ( 1MDB ) .
Former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was charged on four counts over his role in a multi - billion dollar corruption scandal in Kuala Lumpur on July 4 , 2018 .
MOHD RASFAN / AFP / Getty Images International attention is on Malaysia 's new government to demonstrate its commitment to political transparency as the criminal case of former scandal - ridden ruler Najib Razak gets underway .
Najib 's Tuesday arrest and subsequent charges -- three criminal breach of trust counts and one offense of abuse of power -- are a major development in a multibillion - dollar corruption case that 's stained the country 's image for years .
The charges are related to $ 10.6 million that was deposited into Najib 's personal bank account from a former unit of state investment fund 1MDB -- a small fraction of the total $ 4.5 billion that the U.S. Justice Department says was misappropriated from 1MDB .
It 's welcomed as yet another milestone for Malaysian democracy after newly minted Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ousted Najib in the country 's biggest - ever political upset nearly two months ago .
The 1MDB case is seen as a way for Mahathir to uphold his campaign pledges of restoring rule of law and abolishing graft in a country where deeply rooted patronage and cronyism have stymied economic and political reforms .
To boost the country 's health , it 's imperative for Mahathir 's team to show that the premier 's office will no longer be exploited , experts have said .
Najib 's legal proceeding " is a test for the new government to see how they are carrying out the rule of law , " said Bridget Welsh , a longtime watcher of Malaysian politics and associate professor of political science at John Cabot University . "
From the perspective of the investment community , this has to be seen as a positive sign because it shows mettle and a willingness to address underlying problems . "
The troubles of 1MDB have not only dented Kuala Lumpur 's reputation with foreign investors , they 've worsened government coffers -- national debt was found to be almost 60 percent higher than previous estimates due to previously hidden liabilities related to 1MDB .
Najib , who cleared himself of wrongdoing during his time in office , released a pre - recorded video message following his arrest saying that not every accusation against him was true .
That raises the possibility of a plea bargain , with the defense team potentially seeking a massive fine in exchange for zero or minimal prison time , said Ei Sun Oh , principal advisor at Kuala Lumpur - based Pacific Research Center .
But given mounting public pressure for the 64 year - old 's imprisonment , the courts may not agree to any deal . "
There is a huge clamor for his arrest , subsequent prosecution and hopefully conviction ... that [ was ] one of the impetus that propelled the current government into power , " explained Oh .
The public " wants change , they want to see blood , " said Wong Chen , a Malaysian parliament member and supporter of the current ruling party .
Despite being granted bail , Najib will still ultimately spend years in jail , Wong projected .
A fair trial
Former NBA player Kermit Washington was sentenced on Monday to six years in federal prison for convictions on charity fraud .
He was also ordered to pay nearly $ 970,000 in restitution .
The U.S. Attorney 's Office in the western district of Missouri stated in a news release that the 66-year - old Washington " abused his fame and status to promote a charity scam by which he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars that he diverted to personal spending on lavish vacations , shopping sprees , and even plastic surgery for his girlfriend . "
Washington -- best known for knocking out Houston 's Rudy Tomjanovich with a devastating punch in a 1977 game -- told donors that the funds were going toward charitable work in Africa for starving and HIV - positive children .
In November 2017 , Washington pleaded guilty in federal court in Kansas City , Mo. , to making a false statement on his tax return and to aggravated identity theft .
MORE : Hawks rookie Trae Young breaks out in Vegas summer league debut MORE : Cavaliers GM on LeBron James ' departure : ' Hurt ' but ' extremely thankful ' " His fraud scheme also victimized law - abiding taxpayers by stealing from the public treasury rather than paying taxes owed , " the U.S. Attorney 's Office noted .
Washington played for five NBA teams in the 1970s and 1980s .
He was with the Los Angeles Lakers when he hit Tomjanovich in what has since been remembered as " The Punch . "
Washington was suspended for 60 days after Tomjanovich was hospitalized for several injuries -- a fractured skull , broken jaw , broken nose and leakage of spinal fluid .
He eventually needed surgery to reconstruct his face .
Former UCLA basketball standout Billy Knight was found dead early Sunday morning in Phoenix .
Phoenix Police Sgt .
Vince Lewis says Knight 's body was found along a road near a construction site .
No evidence of foul play was found .
Knight , 39 , played at UCLA from 1998 - 2002 , averaging 14.1 points and 3.5 rebounds per game as a senior .
The Bruins went to the NCAA tournament all four of Knight 's seasons under coach Steve Lavin , reaching the regional semifinals in each of his last three years .
A day before his body was found , Knight recorded a chilling video on YouTube which he titled " I am Sorry Lord . "
In it , he says , " I am lost in life and I feel like there is no hope ... I just feel like I ca n't continue on . "
He urges people who have problems like his to get help .
Knight 's death is the second one of a former UCLA player in the past week , following Tyler Honeycutt , who died Friday after barricading himself inside his home in Sherman Oaks , Calif. , of what police said appeared to be a self - inflicted gunshot wound .

Its got a Saturday morning cartoon - like feel and its very accessible , " GameSpot vice president and general manager Ben Howard told CNBCs " On the Money " in an interview . "
The game is completely free to download and play , with all the monetization coming on cosmetic items that do nt affect the gameplay , " Howard explained , such as " a costume , a hat for your character , that kind of thing . "
Howard admitted he s spent some of his own cash on Fortnite accessories , costumes and dance moves for his avatar . "
Sometimes you want that skin for your character .
You want that superhero outfit , you want that cowboy outfit .
You know , its hard to say why its compelling .
But it is . "
Four - time NBA champion Shaquille ONeal said LeBron James move to Los Angeles is not enough for the Lakers to match the Golden State Warriors " superteam . "
Appearing on CNBCs " Fast Money Halftime Report , " the former LA Lakers star reflected on James move , the rise of superteams and the overall state of the NBA . "
He s a very marketable guy ... but you must win at some point , " ONeal said about James .
O'Neal , who played eight seasons for the Lakers from 1996 - 2004 , won three championships alongside Kobe Bryant while in LA .
He said winning championships is what helped make him the businessman he is today . "
When I was there [ in LA ] doing stuff , I was taking a lot of flack for not winning , " O'Neal said . "
Once I started winning , then everything was like on steroids .
It elevated for me , business - wise . "
James has dozens of top - tier endorsement deals , appears in commercials , has his own production company , and has appeared on TV shows and in the Hollywood movie " Trainwreck , " but the three - time NBA champion has an uphill battle in Los Angeles .
He joins a team that finished the 2017 - 2018 season 35 - 47 , failing to make the playoffs . "
I think for him to be considered a great Laker , he definitely has to win a championship , " said ONeal .
James joins an already crowded West Coast .
The Golden State Warriors of Oakland , California , have built what some refer to as a superteam , filled with some of the biggest stars in the game : Steph Curry , Kevin Durant , Klay Thompson .
Winning three championships in the last four years , the Warriors do nt seem to be letting up after a major postseason signing of four - time NBA All - Star DeMarcus Cousins . "
In my opinion , this is the most talented starting five in the history of the game , " ONeal said . "
The good thing about the Golden State superteam is they play an excellent style of basketball . "
As much fun as the Warriors are to watch , ONeal said superteams are watering down the game of basketball . "
We grew up watching Magic and Larry Bird duke it out , Isaiah and Mike duke it out , we grew up watching Tim Duncan and the Lakers duke it out .
Now you have all these guys on one team .
Hopefully , one day it gets back to that , " he said .

From business friendliness to education , the exclusive CNBC 2018 America 's Top States for Business study crunches the numbers on what matters most to a business when choosing where to expand or set up a new corporate footprint .
This year we asked chief financial officers at leading U.S. companies who are members of the CNBC Global CFO Council what motivates their firms to choose one location over another .
The news for America 's workers is mixed -- corporations care a great deal about the skills you have to offer them when selecting worksites , but much less about your quality of life as measured by costs such as housing and living expenses .
Help wanted Workforce topped the list when it comes to what matters most to CFOs when they are weighing their options to operate or expand in a new location , followed by cost of doing business and infrastructure .
Quality of life , education and cost of living were among the least important factors .
The executives priorities are somewhat different from the attributes that states are pitching as they try to attract companies .
Those sales pitches are what CNBC uses to weight the categories in our annual Americas Top States for Business study , based on a review of all 50 states economic development marketing campaigns .
Like the executives , states are also emphasizing their workforce the most .
That is followed by infrastructure , cost of doing business , quality of life , technology and innovation , education , business friendliness , access to capital and cost of living .
Finding top talent is a persistent problem for employers : 84 percent of respondents said they are presently struggling to fill skilled positions .
According to U.S.-based CFO Council members , low unemployment and lack of education and training are among the top reasons they keep coming up short in their hunts .
Trump tax law leads to split among corporations When it comes to choosing a location in which to operate after the newly imposed limits on state and local tax breaks , the council was split .
More than half of respondents said the new limits would not affect their choice of location to set up shop , while 47 percent said it would be a factor in their decision - making .
FuelCell Energy Inc. FCEL , -8.18 % said Wednesday it is planning to add more than 100 manufacturing jobs as it increases annual production to 55 megawatts from the current 25 megawatts run rate .

Our financial performance has reflected the impact of the reduced manufacturing run - rate over the past couple of years , costing the business over $ 12 million annually in under - absorbed factory overhead , " Chief Executive Chip Bottone said in a statement . "
Once this production increase is fully implemented , we will no longer have this drag on our financial results . "

It still sounds exciting and fresh . "

Theme for Great Cities , " Simple Minds Unlike other new wave or new romantic bands in the early ' 80s , Simple Minds eschewed minimalist , flat beats and tones and went for spacious and looming soundscapes on " Sisters Feelings Call " and " Sons and Fascination . "

Gas explosion in Sun Prairie , Wisconsin kills firefighter A gas explosion leveled several buildings in downtown Sun Prairie , Wisconsin , injuring multiple people and killing one firefighter .
Gas prices this week are expected to be the highest Independence Day average in years .
But changing up your driving habits can save you serious money at the pump .
Across the U.S. , the American Automobile Association expects gas prices to hit an average of $ 2.86 per gallon this week .
That s up from $ 2.23 a year ago and is the highest July Fourth week in four years , according to AAA .
But the Consumer Federation of America estimates people could significantly improve their gas mileage by making a few simple changes .
In fact , depending on what your driving habits are now , you could reduce your gas costs by as much as $ 2 per gallon . "
Paying less for gas means buying more snow - cones and Fourth of July treats , " says Jack Gillis , CFAs executive director and author of " The Car Book . "
Here are five money - saving habits .
Keep off the brakes Estimated savings : $ 0.99 / gallon Try to avoid unnecessary braking while on the road .
By driving with a light foot , you ll not only save at the pump , but your cars brake equipment will last longer .
Gillis estimates by keeping your foot off the brake more , you can save up to 35 percent in gas .
Be a smooth operator Estimated savings : $ 0.54 / gallon Ease into accelerating and decelerating as much as possible when you drive .
If you re driving smoothly and avoiding the stopping and starting jerks , you can achieve a gas savings of about 33 percent on the highway , Gillis says .
That can really add up if you re planning a long road trip over the holiday .
For example , Consumer Reports tested an older Toyota Camry and found that driving with " frequent bursts of acceleration and braking " reduced mileage by 2 to 3 mpg .
Stay properly aligned Estimated savings : $ 0.28 / gallon Make sure your cars wheel alignment is in good shape .
If your car is out of alignment , it not only wears out your tires faster , Gillis says it also makes your engine work harder .
This can reduce your gas mileage by as much as 10 percent .
Slow down Estimated savings : $ 0.20 / gallon Slower really is better when it comes to gas mileage . "
Overall , speeding up from 55 mph to 75 is like moving from a compact car to a large SUV , " according to Consumer Reports .
In general , the optimal speed for fuel efficiency in most car models is around 55 - 60 mph .
Gillis finds that for every 5 mph you drop your speed on a highway , you can reduce your fuel consumption by 7 percent .

GDP growth really a demographic issue , economist says Gene Goldman , Cetera Investment Management chief investment officer and director of research , and Scott Brown , Raymond James chief economist , discuss their market and economic outlooks for the rest of the year and into 2019 .
Gemini Trust , the cryptocurrency exchange founded by brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss , named NYSE 's top technology executive to be its first chief technology officer , another sign the wild west digital currency sector is moving more mainstream .
Robert Cornish was NYSE 's chief information officer , a role that oversaw the Big Board 's ongoing electronic trading overhaul .
He joins Gemini later this month , according to the company 's announcement , where he will take over technology initiatives .
A wave of Wall Street executives have jumped to digital currency startups this year , giving the sector once considered a fringe movement added legitimacy .
Former Goldman Sachs executive Richard Kim became the chief operating officer of Mike Novogratz 's Galaxy Digital , CNBC reported earlier this year .
And Michael Bucella left Goldman for BlockTower Capital , a crypto firm founded by former Goldman vice president Matt Goetz .
At Gemini , Cornish " will ensure that Gemini continues to deliver the best platform experience to our customers as possible and set the standards of excellence for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole , " Tyler Winklevoss , Gemini 's CEO , said in the statement .
Gemini recently won New York state regulatory approval to offer bitcoin cash and litecoin for trading and custody and is the first to receive a New York license for trading in Zcash , another cryptocurrency .

German owners of the Tesla TSLA , -4.35 % Model S have been ordered by a government agency to repay a 4,000 euros ( $ 4,640 ) subsidy on electric vehicles , because the cars are too expensive to qualify for the government program .
The Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control , which goes by the acronym BAFA , said it has attempted to hold talks with Tesla in recent months on the issue , but has failed to reach agreement .
The subsidy is available for electric cars that cost no more than 60,000 euros , which is the list price for the basic Model S. But Tesla has been unable until now to deliver the basic model to its German clients , and more expensive trims do not qualify .
About 800 customers are affected , according to a BAFA release .
Customers who ordered a Model S after March 6 will receive the subsidy , after Telsa said it can deliver a basic version of the car .
Tesla shares were down 0.9 % Wednesday , but have gained 2.7 % in 2018 , while the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has gained 5 % .

Getty Images After nearly two decades of student loan payments , Lisa Wickman saw the light .
Her new fiance offered to help her put an end to the persistent debt .
And so the elementary school teacher from Grand Blanc , Michigan , mailed a $ 7,000 check in February to Navient , one of the country 's largest student - loan servicers .
Weeks went by , and the payment still did nt show up on her account . "
It got very frustrating , " said the 53-year - old Wickman .
Finally , she called .
She said a representative told her that shed mailed the check to the wrong address . "
They led me to believe it was a completely different place I d sent my check to -- but it really was Navient , " she said .
Indeed , shed found the address on the servicers website and the $ 7,000 check was cleared , and gone from her bank account .
She said the representative at Navient told her shed be refunded in four to six weeks , but months rolled by and the money still had nt returned . "
I was told different things by different people , " Wickman said .
Four months after shed sent the check , she was finally refunded the $ 7,000 , but in the meantime interest had accrued . (
She said Navient is now working to discharge those additional fees ) .
Paul Hartwick , vice president of corporate communications at Wilmington , Delaware - based Navient , said he could not immediately provide details about Wickman 's case .
However , he said the servicer has recently made updates to its website " to make it even easier for customers to provide instructions related to additional payments . "
He added , " We work very hard to make it easy for our customers to repay their loans . "
Lisa Wickman wanted to make a dent in her student loans , but then something went wrong .
Making extra payments on your student loans can reduce overall interest and free you from your debt years earlier .
Yet the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reports that borrowers trying to get ahead on their education debt can be sidetracked by their student loan servicer .
accounted for 17 percent of all student loan complaints during the second quarter of 2016 , according to the Bureau .
I was told different things by different people .
Lisa Wickman a student loan borrower Student loan experts agree : trying to make extra payments on your education debt can bring on headaches . "
Different loan types could be handled by different offices by the different servicers , " said Elaine Griffin Rubin , senior contributor and communications specialist at Edvisors and a former employee of the U.S. Department of Educations office of Federal Student Aid .
Head - spinning , huh ?
But do n't give up yet .
A CNBC reporter recently about how paying just $ 25 more a month ( on top of your regular payments ) on a $ 30,000 student loan balance with an 8 percent interest rate and a 10-year repayment term can save you more than $ 1,000 in the end along with an entire year of monthly payments .
You just want to proceed with caution . "
There are important things you should be doing as a borrower to make sure your extra payments are really getting you ahead , " said Diane Cheng , associate research director at the nonprofit group The Institute for College Access and Success . (
Although private student loans come with their own rules , those lenders are prohibited from imposing fees and penalties on borrowers for early repayment ) .
Be clear First , if you 're paying your student loan by check , make sure you 're sending it to the address on your billing statement , said Griffin Rubin . "
There 's a lot of issues of checks going to the wrong place , " she said .
You 'll want to specify that you 're making an extra payment and not an early payment . "
You absolutely have to send it in with instructions , " said Mark Kantrowitz , publisher of SavingforCollege.com and a student loan expert .
Otherwise the servicer will simply not bill you the next month or months , and the purpose of your extra payment -- to stave off interest and be done paying sooner -- is cancelled out .
More from Personal Finance If you 're paying by check , write that it 's an extra payment to be applied to your balance in the memo line .
If you 're paying online , there should be a spot for you to write this information in a comments section .
If you 're trying to target your extra payment to a particular loan ( experts recommend doing so to the one with the highest interest rate ) , specify that , by providing the loan ID number with the amount you want applied .
Do n't assume everything will go well . "
Always double check , " Griffin Rubin said . "
I 've seen mistakes happen , the comments did n't save for some reason . "
If you do n't see your extra payment applied , or applied correctly , it 's time to call your servicer .
Time the payment strategically Gina Pricope | Getty Images Lots of student borrowers bemoan the fact that their money is put toward interest , and they do n't see their balance go down .
There 's actually a federal regulation that says student loan payments are applied first to collection charges and late fees ( if there are any ) , then to interest and finally , to your principal . "
Principal is actually last on that list , " Griffin Rubin said .
That 's why Kantrowitz recommends sending in your extra payment a day or two after your regular payment . "
That regular payment will have taken care of the interest and so that extra payment will go entirely to principal , " Kantrowitz said .
Make sure it 's the right move for you

To be sure , retiring in a new country will require studying up on the tax implications along with pulling off some other logistical maneuvering .
But for many older Americans the work will be well worth finding a new , affordable place to spend their golden years .

Getty Images Scroll through Apple 's app store and you ll find plenty of fitness options .
With so much variety , it can be hard to choose .
I sampled a few different apps that people have recommended to me .
Aaptiv One of my colleagues recommended Aaptiv to me earlier this year .
I was skeptical of paying for a fitness app , but she shared her code with me for a free 30-day trial .
At the time , I was considering signing up for a half marathon .
I saw Aaptiv had a program for it and decided to give it a try .
Each workout is an audio track , with no visuals or videos .
A trainer guides me through , giving instructions , sharing tips and encouraging me along the way .
Now three weeks out from the race , I 'm still training with Aaptiv .
I use some of Aaptiv 's other classes for arms and ab workouts .
Most of the time I 'm able to understand the instructions without seeing what they look like .
Sometimes I need to pause the track to look up the move being described .
For this review , I tested a yoga class , an exercise I never do and one that involves the trainer describing poses .
The instruction was clear and I put my feet and hands in the correct places , but it would 've been helpful to see an image or video of the correct form .
While I was at the gym , a real - world yogi walked over and pressed down on my back during downward dog because I was apparently doing something that looked more like a quasi plank .
I would n't have known without seeing the correct form .
Aaptiv is geared toward people who need clear instruction while working out .
For the most part , it 's helpful , but some may find themselves wanting a bit more guidance .
Cost : $ 14.99 per month , $ 99.99 per year Peloton Digital Peloton 's known for its cycling classes , but the company recently called Peloton Digital with a variety of workouts , including walking , yoga , strength training and running .
I tried a treadmill workout , which was a video track .
Peloton 's outdoor running tracks are audio only since people probably ( hopefully ) are n't looking at their phones while they 're running .
Even though I was stationary on a treadmill , I did n't love looking down at a tiny screen .
The class I chose was hard .
It was less than half an hour , but I felt like I had worked out for much longer .
We ran some intervals that were fast and others where we were recreating running up hills .
My instructor kept me aware of what was coming , what pace I should be running and how much I should increase or decrease the incline .
Peloton Digital will appeal to people who want both a challenging workout and some guidance .
Cost : $ 19.49 per month Sweat Kayla Itsines is known for her Bikini Body Guides .
They were formerly available as PDFs but are now easily accessible in the app store with Sweat .
When signing up , the app helped me select a program .
I chose the classic BBG and tried an arms resistance workout .
The workout consisted of two circuits to be completed twice .
Each round takes seven minutes , for a total of 28 minutes .
Each move is accompanied by a video of Kayla performing it so users can see what it should look like .
I found this feature helpful .
I had tried BBG a few years ago using the PDF and could n't perform a lay - down push - up no matter how hard I tried .
When using the app , I realized that 's because I had been doing it incorrectly .
The circuits were challenging .
It took me a minute , but I did find when you click on an exercise it opens a window with step by step instructions of the standard version and an alternative version .
Each program includes different workouts depending on what week you 're on , making it easy to keep going .
Sweat is ideal for people who want a structured program plus help keeping track of their progress and results .
Cost : $ 19.99 per month , $ 239.88 per year Sworkit This app makes it incredibly easy to customize your workouts .
Sworkit has programs like " July Challenge " and collections like " Better for Beginners " and " Advanced Workouts . "
They also have exercises grouped by type , such as strength and subcategories like full body , upper body and more .
To start , I chose lower body .
When I clicked select , the app asked me how many minutes I wanted to work out .
That was something I had n't seen before , and I liked having the option to work out for as little as five minutes and as many as 60 .
Similar to Sweat , Sworkit shows a moving image of a person performing the exercise you 're supposed to do .
It had me perform each one for 30 seconds , a manageable time for each that kept me moving without wearing myself out too much .
The option to choose the duration is great for people who want a workout made for them but have a limited amount of time .
Users can also create their own workouts where they can choose the moves they want to perform .
This could be helpful for people who want some guidance or routine from an app but do n't want someone choosing everything .

Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant , a two - time NBA Finals MVP , continues to take on social media detractors .
His latest argument was with a 17-year - old .
Nearly a year after he blasted his former team on Twitter while thinking he was using a burner account -- a gaffe he later referred to as " childish " and " idiotic " -- Durant sparred on Tuesday with teenager Kalyb Champion , who challenged Durant 's legacy through his Instagram account bucketscenter .
The initial post by Champion , which tagged Durant 's official Instagram account , featured a three - way photo of Durant , Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis -- describing them as " 3 elite two - way players but do n't elevate a team quite like LeBron and Steph due to their playmaking / leadership deficiencies . "
Durant jabbed back by telling Champion to " go sweep ya dorm room " in a response to the post .
Champion , in stride , called Durant " insecure " for even responding .
Then over private message Durant called Champion a " middle school / knock off ( Stephen A. Smith ) " and went on to say he 's not " too big and famous " to respond .
Champion later posted the messages for others to see the exchange .

Habits are what make you who you are .
They re hard to form , hard to break , and there s a wealth of advice telling you which ones to add to your daily routine .
But what if some of your " good " habits are actually holding you back ?
The truth is , you may need to drop existing habits to move forward in life , even ones you thought were , or ones that used to be , helpful .
Surrounding yourself with high achievers is good , and saying " yes " to opportunities is good , too , but do n't feel that you need to fill your calendar , especially if you are making plans for the sake of making plans , for example .
Spending too much time around other people can leave you overstimulated and without the time you need to set your own goals .
Maybe your " good " habit involves leading regular meetings at work so that everyone 's on the same page , or toggling quickly from one task to another to be as productive as possible -- but lately you 've noticed the meetings and the multitasking are leaving you drained , not energized .
It can serve you to eliminate habits that are n't actually good for you anymore -- but first you have to identify them and then unlearn them .
In fact , unlearning habits can be just as valuable as acquiring them in the first place .
What is unlearning ?
Unlearning is the process of identifying and letting go of habits you no longer need .
If you are an American who is learning to drive in England , you have to unlearn the habit of staying on the right side of the road .
Companies like Facebook and Google were able to innovate precisely because they threw out previously held assumptions about the possibilities of the internet .
Unlearning is a necessary step for finding the best approaches for you .
The Unlearning Process There are three steps to unlearning a habit .
1 .
Recognize that your current actions no longer serve your needs This wo nt be easy because most of what we do happens without conscious thought .
It helps to try to adopt an outside perspective .
What would you usually ignore that other people see ?
For instance , are you a habitual multitasker at work ?
Experiment : Spend a day or two focusing on only one task at a time .
Multitasking may be a skill that you do n't need to utilize as often as you think , or one that does n't actually help you at all .
2 .
Identify or create a habit that works better If your habit was no longer an option , what would you do instead ?
What alternative might work better for you ?
Take the example of a weekly business meeting of team and board members .
Sure , it 's important to communicate and exchange information .
But how efficient is this meeting in practice ?
Is there always new information ?
Does everyone need to be there for it ?
If not , how can you share information so that you only need to meet once every two or three weeks ?
And try re - structuring your meetings , like by imposing time limits so that you discuss prioritized topics first and follow up on less pressing updates by e - mail .
3 .
Practice to ingrain the new habit After you 've identified what works best for you , implement it in your daily life .
Actively remind yourself to do it .
It 's very important to write down the new habit that you are striving for .
Creating an accountability structure with others can also be helpful .
Remember that ingraining new mental habits is as much of a gradual process as ingraining physical or behavioral habits .
Be conscious of your actions and be patient with yourself during the transition .

Here are Trump 's notable quotes from the past week CNBC keeps track of President Donald Trump 's most outrageous , news - making and world - changing statements each week , so you do n't have to .
Here 's what the president said this week .
Here 's National Geographic photographer Joel Sartore on felines that lurk in the shadows : Years ago , in the Bolivian Amazon , a jaguar came so close to my photographer 's blind I could hear her breathing .
But she did n't make a sound with her feet ; not one leaf crunched or twig snapped .
As an ambush hunter , she must be either completely silent or starve to death .
She vanished into the foliage as if walking on air .
Now , if a bright - orange , 150-lb .
jaguar can be that stealthy , imagine what a small wild cat is capable of .
Some call them Shadow Cats , and there are 31 species around the world , ranging in size from the Iberian lynx to the three - pound flat - headed cat .
There 's the characal , the margay , and the clouded leopard .
Never heard of 'em ?
Few of us have , and yet they 're all around us .
Examples of wild cats : The characal , the margay and the clouded leopard .
CBS News If you hike or camp , it 's likely you 've been watched by one without ever knowing it .
In North America , it could have been a panther .
In South America , perhaps an oncilla .
They 've been there for eons , in the mountains , in rain forests , marshes and deserts .
But twenty five years in the field and I 've never seen one with my own eyes .
Never !
Instead , I 've had to use camera traps , unmanned motion detectors , just to get these few images from the wild .
Gotcha !
Joel Sartore Each species is a masterpiece of natural camouflage .
The spotted pattern on an ocelot allows it to melt into the brush , while a Pallas 's cat blends in perfectly with the rocks of its Himalayan home .
It 's no wonder so little is known about them .
Take the marbled cat : just what is that huge tail for ?
Only one cat , one , has been studied in the wild so far , and researchers think the tail may be used for balance on night patrols , high up in the forest .
Oh , and it can turn its hind feet around 180 degrees backward , just like a squirrel , to walk straight down trees .
But while these shadow cats are exotic , the faces are familiar .
Your house cat could be a descendant of an African wildcat , and curled up on your lap , it 's every bit as amazing as all the rest .
That purring you hear is n't random ; it 's evolved over millions of years and is thought to heal bones and muscles , not to mention relax their owners .
And did you know that your pet is one of the few domestic animals that can return to the wild and actually thrive there ?
Best to keep that kitty inside , though ; cats are efficient predators , and can kill native wildlife , including songbirds .
After years of studying small cats for National Geographic , though , I 've come to just one conclusion : they 're simply beautiful - from the jaguarondi and the jungle cat , to the serval and the bobcat .
So , next time you take a hike , think about these shadow cats , and look around carefully .
It wo n't do you a bit of good , though !

Heres some red meat for those of you who enjoying hating on millennials .
A young marketing intern , with a predilection for -- you guessed it -- avocado toast and hot yoga , wrote a piece for Refinery29s " Money Diaries , " in which she described how she manages to afford to live in New York City on $ 25 an hour in wages and the occasional babysitting gig .
Sounds rough .
After all , her rent alone is $ 2,100 a month .
Not to mention such necessities as regular " Brazilian Sugarings " ( had to look that one up ) , sufficient amounts of alcohol , Icelandic yogurt , Uber rides and the occasional trip out to the Hamptons with the " girl squad . "
Oh , but there s a secret to her financial success , and its in this tweet : So , in a series of articles aimed at " tackling what might be the last taboo facing modern working women : money , " the website uses an example of a young female who gets her rent , student loans , phone bill , Netflix NFLX , -3.76 % , Spotify AND Amazon AMZN , -1.81 % all paid for by her parents .

Home prices make biggest jump in four years CNBC 's Diana Olick reports on home values jumping 7.1 percent in June compared with a year ago , the biggest annual jump in four years .
Homebuilders are on shaky ground this year , but according to one top technical analyst Toll Brothers could be gearing up for a rebound .
Shares of the Pennsylvania - based construction company have fallen nearly 24 percent since January and are on track for their worst monthly losing streak in history .
However , Carter Worth , head of technical analysis at Cornerstone Macro , says there s something in the charts indicating a big reversal ahead .
According to Worths analysis , despite a series of sharp rallies and sell - offs in the past decade , shares of Toll Brothers have consistently thrown back to its 150-day moving average , implying " [ the ] mean reversion trade has been quite profitable . " "
I m going to make the bet that this decline is due for some sort of throwback , " Worth said Friday on CNBCs " Options Action . "
In addition , Worth noted that although the stock has recently broken below its long - standing support at the $ 40 level , he believes it has found a new bottom around the $ 35 mark , which it has previously bounced off .
Shares of Toll Brothers are up more than 34 percent in the past two years but have still lagged behind the broader consumer discretionary sector -- which is up more than 37 percent in the same time .
Yet according to Worths chart work , shares of the homebuilder have started to reverse off a multiyear low relative to consumer discretionary , signaling a potential break to the upside ahead . "
We are literally on the prior low , and I think were going to hold , " he explained , " so I want to make a bet its so bad its good . "
Toll Brothers is down 8 percent in the past 12 months and was trading lower on Monday .
Homecomings are nt always sweet .
And for Lina and her husband , Wei , they can be outright dangerous when a long - lost brothers return threatens to pull their family apart .
This seemingly inconspicuous visit sparks generations of stories fraught with star - crossed romance , familial anxiety and expat privilege in Lucy Tans debut novel , " What We Were Promised " ( Little , Brown , 336 pp . ,
1/2 out of four ) .
The book takes place in Shanghai , a hybrid city - part frenetic metropolis and part historical monument , constantly morphed by both Chinese and global influences .
Its the perfect setting for Tan as she artfully tumbles back and forth in time and place , from the silk factories of Lina and Weis childhoods to the lonely landscapes of America and back to China again , where they try to reconcile family tensions in the wealthy high - rises of Shanghai .
Rather fittingly , the novel starts in transit .
In 1988 , Lina and Wei stand in the Shanghai Hongqiao airport terminal , on their way to start new lives in America .
Just months before their arranged marriage , Lina fell in love with Qiang , Weis rebellious younger brother , who suddenly disappeared and is assumed dead because of his gang involvement .
Fast - forward 22 years , and Wei receives a call from Qiang , who is very much alive and wants to reconcile with his brother and Lina .
But a lot has changed in the time Qiang has been gone : Both Lina and Wei have spent years working for success in America , and are back in China as wealthy expats .
Lina and Wei 's parents are dead from a tragic train crash , but the two now have a quick - witted daughter named Karen , who studies in the States .
Though the three of them spend their summer days together in Shanghais luxurious Lanson Suites , Lina finds that they really live in the " in - between , " a space that is neither Chinese nor American . "
What had been the point of immigrating if not to enjoy American privilege ? "
the novel asks .
The answer is not so simple , Tan illustrates , as she takes her time fleshing out the multitudes that go into an identity : national obligations , family responsibility , the guilt of newfound wealth , and above all , love .
The family drama unfolds quietly in front of Sunny , their ever - perceptive housekeeper in China .
She adds her own dimension to the story after her co - worker , Rose , steals Linas treasured ivory bracelet , a shameful admittance that the foreign and expatriate wealthy residents " belongings had power over ( Rose ) , that their wealth was worth exactly what they wanted it to be worth . " "
What We Were Promised " is bustling with themes like these , ones that focus on the terrifyingly complex facets of what it means to be Chinese - American , an immigrant , and an expat .
But Tan certainly has enough bandwidth to handle these heavy topics , sifting them through a single family with forlorn honesty and compassion .
The only time Tans extraordinary pacing fails is when the central conflict between Lina and Qiang is resolved quickly after Qiang 's return .
All it takes is the revelation of a single secret , wrapping up this sweeping family drama too neatly .
But its a small critique , because " What We Were Promised " glows through its intimate , skillful prose .
Tans debut is a beautiful reckoning with the ever - changing definition of " home " - what it means to have , lose and find family again .
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. 388 , -1.38 % touted progress in letting mainland Chinese investors trade locally listed companies with supervoting shares , giving Xiaomi Corp 1810 , +5.73 % a boost .
On Wednesday , Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. said it had reached a " consensus " with peers in Shanghai and Shenzhen over dual - class shares .
That came days after those market operators unexpectedly barred companies using these structures from Stock Connect , a trading link that lets mainland investors buy Hong Kong shares and vice versa .
That was a setback for Hong Kong , which wants to attract large technology listings by offering access to both Chinese and international money managers .
Xiaomi , the smartphone maker , was the first to list under new rules allowing companies with two classes of voting stock .
Representatives from the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges declined to comment Wednesday .
Companies with weighted voting rights will first have to trade for a while in Hong Kong , in what the exchange termed a " special stability trading period . "
The three listing venues will also work together to develop " specific programs and supplementary rules , " said the Hong Kong exchange .
Shares in Beijing - based Xiaomi 1810 , -0.61 % hit fresh highs during Wednesday trading , closing up 3.1 % at HK$21.55 , while the broader Hang Seng Index fell 0.2 % .
Xiaomi shares have gained 28 % since debuting on July 9 , despite a lackluster first - day performance .

House Republicans are threatening former FBI lawyer Lisa Page with contempt proceedings after she failed to appear for a deposition Wednesday despite a subpoena .
Page was scheduled to appear in a private interview as part of a joint investigation by the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform Committees into allegations of bias against President Donald Trump within the Justice Department .
Page 's attorney , Amy Jeffress , told the committee Tuesday she would not appear , saying Page needed more time to prepare and that Page was still trying to get copies of FBI documents ahead of her deposition .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Robert Goodlatte said in a statement Wednesday that " none of the excuses " Jeffress offered " hold water . "
Goodlatte and House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Trey Gowdy , R - S.C. , told Jeffress in a letter that Page had been properly served .
The chairmen said that if she did not answer their questions by Friday at 10:30 a.m. EDT , they would begin contempt proceedings .
Contempt votes are rare in Congress and often largely symbolic .
If the full House does vote to hold someone in contempt , the matter then moves to the courts , where it has often stalled . "
We are aware of the issues raised regarding access to documents by the FBI , " Goodlatte and Gowdy wrote . "
We are also aware of committee efforts to schedule your clients appearance for over six months now . "
Goodlatte and Gowdy said Page could appear at a public hearing Thursday , give a deposition Friday or do both .
Page exchanged text messages that were highly critical of Trump with FBI agent Peter Strzok , who will testify publicly before the panels Thursday .
Page and Strzok both worked on the FBI investigation into Democrat Hillary Clintons emails and , later , on special counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation .
More : Peter Strzok , FBI agent who wrote anti - Trump texts , to testify publicly before lawmakers More : Watchdog rebukes ex - FBI director Comey over Clinton email case , but found no evidence of bias " ( Trump 's ) not ever going to become president , right ? "
Page wrote in a text to agent Peter Strzok just months before the 2016 election . "
No .
No he 's not , " Strzok said . "
We 'll stop it . "
Trump has seized on Page and Strzoks inflammatory texts , which were detailed in a report by the Justice Departments internal watchdog last month , to paint the FBI and Muellers investigation as biased . "
Congressional subpoenas for testimony are not optional , " House Speaker Paul Ryan , R - Wisc . ,
said in response to Page 's failure to appear . "
She was part of the mess we ve uncovered at DOJ .
She has an obligation to come testify .
If she wants to come plead the Fifth ( Amendment ) , that s her choice .
But a subpoena to testify before Congress is not optional .
Its mandatory .
She needs to comply . "
When asked if Page should be held in contempt , Ryan said , " We will do what we need to do to protect this branch of government . "
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R - Calif . ,
said Page has " a duty to testify so the American People get the truth .
No one is above the law ! "
House Judiciary member Rep. Andy Biggs , R - Ariz . ,
was much more direct in his call for contempt proceedings . "
Lisa Page , along with current and former Department of Justice employees , continue to deny Congresss constitutional oversight authority , " Biggs said . "
There should be consequences for this willful rebellion .
I am tired of the excuses and misdirection .
Congress must act to quell further insubordination . "
Trump weighed in from Brussels , tweeting , " Ex - FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress !
Wow , but is anybody really surprised !
Together with her lover , FBI Agent Peter Strzok , she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt , perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER ! "

How trade frictions with the US have impacted China 's markets Liang Hong of CICC says the " softness " in China 's equity markets is mainly attributable to domestic policy by the government rather than the country 's trade frictions with the U.S.
How worried should retirees be that the Chinese stock market is now in a bear market -- having dropped by more than 20 % ?
Its an important question because it seems like few others are even paying attention .
Wall Street appears to be comforted by the S&P 500 US : SPX being up for the year , if modestly -- up nearly 5 % .
But that s little solace for retirees whose portfolios are often significantly diversified into non - U.S. stocks .
How unusual is it for a leading foreign stock market to diverge so significantly from the U.S. market ?
When such divergences do occur , do they mean that the U.S. market is likely to soon catch up to the rest of the world , or vice versa ?
Its a cliche these days to say this , but the core insight that allows us to understand these and related phenomena is that the worlds financial markets have become increasingly interconnected -- dramatically so , in fact .
This means that , while the divergence were currently seeing between U.S. and Chinese stocks would not have been all that unusual many years ago , it has become increasingly rare in recent decades .
Its easy to quantify the degree to which the markets have become interconnected .
Take a look at the accompanying chart , which plots the correlation over the trailing five years between U.S. and foreign equities .
A high coefficient ( approaching +1 ) means that the two have more or less moved up and down in lockstep , while a low reading ( closer to 0 ) means that the two march to the beats of separate drummers . (
I constructed the chart by focusing on MSCIs EAFE index , since for most of the last 50 years the Chinese economy and stock market were tiny compared with those of the U.S. ) Notice that the correlation reached a low point in the late 1990s around 0.20 , but then shot up and has been at or above 0.70 for most of the last 20 years .
Though this dramatic jump was no doubt due to many factors , the immediate trigger of that late-1990s jump was the July 1997 financial crisis in which a series of currency and sovereign debt emergencies led to fears of a world - wide economic meltdown . (
These crises began in Asia , which is why many refer to what happened that summer as " Asian contagion . " )
Another contributing factor to the increasing correlation between U.S. and foreign equities has been the growing share of U.S. corporations operations that come from overseas .
Currently , for example , around half of all U.S. publicly traded firms sales come from overseas .
There are several important investment implications of this increasing correlation : * The current divergence between the U.S. and Chinese markets is unusual , and to that extent is unlikely to persist .
Unfortunately , the historical record does nt help us forecast whether this means that U.S. stocks will soon enter a bear market in order to become more correlated with the Chinese market , or whether Chinese equities will soon rally to catch up with the U.S. In an interconnected world , no one market can be the tail that wags the rest of the worlds dog . *
If the equity portfolio of your portfolio is diversified among both U.S. and non - U.S. stocks , however , it makes relatively little difference which market is likely to catch up with the other .
To that extent , so long as you are diversified , the answer to the question with which I began this column is that you do not need to be unduly worried about what s happening to Chinese stocks . *
To a greater extent than ever before , you get automatic international diversification by investing in just U.S. equities .
An S&P 500 index fund today , for example , will be as diversified internationally as a portfolio 50 years ago that allocated 50 % to that index fund and 50 % to non - U.S. stocks .
That s the good news . *
The bad news : You gain fewer benefits today than in decades past from international diversification .
We no longer live in a world in which what happens to an economy half way around the globe has relatively little impact on our own .
To gain the same extent of that earlier eras diversification , we will have to look beyond equities to other asset classes altogether .
Which other asset classes you should look to for such diversification will have to be subject of another column .
Meanwhile , were left to marvel at how our selective attention can divert our collective gaze from a greater than 20 % drop in the leading stock market benchmark ( the Shanghai Composite CN : SHCOMP ) from the worlds second largest economy .
My hunch is that we all will soon be reading a lot more about what s happening to the Chinese economy in general and stock market in particular -- and how it impacts the U.S. For more information , including descriptions of the Hulbert Sentiment Indices , go to The Hulbert Financial Digest or email mark@hulbertratings.com .

Hundreds of lawsuits claiming Monsanto 's weed killer Roundup caused cancer were given the green light to proceed to trial , a San Francisco judge ruled Tuesday .
The chemical glyphosate , an active ingredient in Roundup , is at the center of the debate .
Cancer victims and families presenting cases say Monsanto knew about the ingredient 's risk for years , but failed to warn buyers .
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said there 's " rather weak " evidence the ingredient causes cancer , but the opinions of three experts linking glyphosate and non - Hodgkins lymphoma were not " junk science . "
Monsanto Vice President Scott Partridge denies any connection between glyphosate and cancer .

Hurricane Chris continued to race out into the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday .
Other than some rough seas along the East Coast , it poses no threat to the USA , the National Hurricane Center said .
The storm could clip Newfoundland , Canada , late Thursday , dumping up to 6 inches of rain and causing flash flooding .
As of 5 p.m. EDT , Chris had winds of 90 mph and was moving to the northeast at 25 mph .
It was about 570 miles east - northeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina .
Swells generated by Hurricane Chris are expected to affect portions of the coasts of North Carolina and the mid - Atlantic states during the next few days , the hurricane center warned . "
These swells could cause life - threatening surf and rip current conditions . "
Rip currents are possible for beaches from Maine to the Carolinas , the National Weather Service said .
At least 15 people have drowned in the USA because of rip currents in 2018 , the weather service reported .
The Canadian Hurricane Centre said southeastern Newfoundland is the most likely to deal with direct impacts from the storm .
The forecast calls for Chris making landfall or passing just south of the Avalon Peninsula as a strong post - tropical storm Thursday evening .
The area could be hit by heavy rain , strong winds and waves with storm surge along parts of the coast , the centre said .
Chris is the second hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season , after Beryl .
It 's unusually early for a second hurricane to form : On average , that does not occur until later in the summer , around Aug. 28 , according to the hurricane center .
Beryl coming back to life ?
The remnants of what was Hurricane Beryl could reorganize off the East Coast by the weekend .
The hurricane center gives the storm a 50 percent chance of regenerating into a tropical depression or storm within the next five days .
If it does reform , it should stay well off the U.S. East Coast , AccuWeather said .
Beryl is not expected to track close enough to the U.S. coast to bring significant rain or wind , AccuWeather hurricane expert Dan Kottlowski said .
It may pass close enough to Bermuda to bring periods of rain , gusty winds and rough surf over the weekend .
Just like Chris , rough seas from Beryl would lead to dangerous beach conditions along the East Coast by the weekend .
Hurricane Chris formed late Tuesday afternoon off the U.S. East Coast , the second hurricane of this year 's Atlantic hurricane season .
Other than churning up some rough seas along the coast , Chris poses no direct threat to the USA as it races out to sea .
It could clip Newfoundland , Canada , later in the week .
As of 5 p.m. EDT , Chris had winds of 85 mph , which makes it a Category 1 hurricane .
The center of Chris was 205 miles east - southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , and was moving to the northeast at 10 mph , the National Hurricane Center said .
Although there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect , ocean swells from the storm " could cause life - threatening surf and rip current conditions " along the U.S. East Coast over the next few days , the hurricane center warned .
Beachgoers in New England may notice roughening surf as the storm passes , according to AccuWeather .
On Monday , in Ocean City , Maryland , the beach patrol made 141 rescues because of strong rip currents .
Chris could make landfall as a post - tropical storm later in the week in southeastern Newfoundland , the Canadian Hurricane Centre said .
If the storm 's track holds , it will bring heavy rain and strong winds and waves along parts of the coast , the center said .
More : Track Hurricane Chris Meanwhile , the remnants of Hurricane Beryl could regenerate into a tropical depression or storm east of Florida within the next few days .
Either way , heavy rains and gusty winds are expected over portions of Hispaniola and the Bahamas , the hurricane center said .
Should the storm regenerate , rough seas could continue to plague swimmers and boaters along the Southeast coast , AccuWeather said .
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were hit by power outages and widespread flooding Monday as Beryl 's remnants hit the Caribbean , the region 's first test since last year 's disastrous hurricane season .
More than 47,000 customers in Puerto Rico lost electricity at the peak of the bad weather , but that number dropped to 13,000 late Monday as crews rushed to restore power .
Up to 5 inches of rain fell across Puerto Rico , the National Weather Service said .
Nearly 2 inches fell in San Juan , the city 's rainiest day of the year .
On the island of Dominica , which was devastated by Maria last year , no landslides or widespread flooding were reported , according to Marshall Alexander of Dominicas Meteorological Service . "
Definitely , we were spared the worst , " he said .

I am , however , very confident and see a bright economic and market future ahead .
I believe the current bull is likely to continue galloping for years to come , pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 40,000 by 2025 .
While some advisors are optimistic that the bull market will continue , others are preparing investors for what they see as its imminent end .
These advisors say that , as the current bull is now the second - longest ever , the odds are overwhelming that it will soon be growing bear fur .
First , lets be clear : The current bull has nt been running as long as most people think .
The popular belief that the current bull started in March 2009 is contradicted by the more than 20 percent dips in many indices that occurred between 2015 and Feb. 11 , 2016 -- arguably , the actual start of a new bull market , after the one that started in 2009 had run out of gas , according to data from Ned Davis Research . (
Under criteria from Davis , there have been 37 bull markets since 1900 , with an average length of 25 months . )
So if you re a member of the how - long - can - it - go club , be duly apprised : This bull market has nt really run that long .
Pessimistic professionals speak in doomsday tones to the accepting ears of investors whose wounds from the financial crisis still have nt healed .
These people remain fearful of a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008 , so talking about signs that economic growth will probably continue for years rubs salt in their wounds .
Think back to the fall of 2014 , when some advisors ( myself among them , in a published article ) predicted that the Dow would hit 20,000 by the end of 2015 .
Until this prediction came true , many regarded it as the audacious predicting the outrageous .
Well , Dow 40,000 by 2025 is actually no less outrageous .
Some might call it irrational exuberance .
But for some undeniably valid economic reasons , this view may not even be exuberant -- just rational .
Amid all the headlines about the U.S. economys current robust state , its easy to lose sight of three things : How badly the economy was brutalized by the Great Recession , the deepest in U.S. history .
Looking back , some economists have said that it was a gnats whisker away from being a depression .
Nerdy technical measures aside , it was just plain bad .
Though the economy has since come a long way , preceded and then accompanied by strong stock market growth , it still has a long way to go to resemble any kind of historical normalcy .
Amid the din of ballyhooing about the " new normal , " its important to remember that economic history repeats itself or , at least , rhymes .
Just how little a stock market propelled by the economys continuation of this journey would have to grow above current levels for the DJIA to reach 40,000 .
To get there by December of 2025 , the index price needs to rise only 6.75 percent ( not including dividends ) annually -- less than the postwar average of 7.2 percent .
More from Straight Talk : How to simplify your financial life ... with two sheets of paper These factors demonstrate the jumping - off point for economic growth driving market gains : High , unmet residual demand for housing .
The U.S. economy perennially relies on housing construction , a stimulus fueled by annual demand for about 1.5 million new housing starts .
Since 2009 , there have been about 8.5 million starts -- some 5.5 million short of the 13.5 million needed for that period .
Pent - up demand is still releasing as Gen Xers move out of their parents basements and families seeking to buy rather than rent ( and Gen Y folks move into their apartments ) .
And even as this demand is satisfied , well still need another 1.5 million starts each year to keep up with trend demand .
Leading economic indicators that continue to point north .
These indicators usually start declining several months before a recession .
There s little reason to believe that the upward trend through May will reverse , considering the slow but steady progress of the recovery thus far .
Rising consumer confidence .
The University of Michigan 's gauge of consumer sentiment -- which measures views of personal financial wherewithal against the favorability of conditions for buying durable goods -- increased to 99.3 in June of 2018 from 98 in May , exceeding market expectations of 98.5 -- the highest in three months in a year marked by far more positive sentiment measurements than in 2017 .
This sentiment is expected to remain high amid declines in unemployment .
Strong current and projected corporate capital spending .
The late 2017 tax cut continues to fuel high levels of corporate investment and potential growth .
In mid - June , the Atlanta Fed 's GDPNow model , which weighs various current gross domestic product components , predicted 4.6 percent national GPD growth for this quarter .
And first - quarter corporate capital spending rose 21 percent year - over - year , on track to be the highest year - over - year growth since 2011 .
These historically high numbers are expected to rise for the year as companies execute spending plans now under development .

If President Donald Trump has nt been brushing up on his Russian in anticipation of his Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin , it may not be a problem .
If he has , he may not want to look out of his helicopter as he flies to see British Prime Minister Theresa May at her country estate on Friday .
That s because an artist has turned part of a field along the route into a 650-foot - wide crop circle containing the word " Trump " -- and a vulgarity written in Russian .
According to the local Bucks Herald newspaper , the circle , which was completed on Sunday about 40 miles northwest of central London , is at Moat Farm in Stoke Mandeville , Buckinghamshire , directly on the flight path to the nearby Chequers estate , which is the official country home of British prime ministers .
The owner of the farm , who requested anonymity , told the Herald that he was approached by an artist , whom he would not name , " to use one of my crop fields . " "
They were specifically looking for one in the flight path that Donald Trump will take when he comes to the U.K. this week , " he added . "
There was a financial transaction , I wo n't say how much but it was remuneration for the damaged crops , which wo n't be salvageable . "
According to The Russian Blog , a website that discusses translations , the word in question means " whore , " but is often used more broadly . "
It is considered to be a general - purpose insult to anyone , so it may be used with both women and men , " it added .

When asked his feelings about Trump , the farmer said he had none . "
A lot of people have asked me this , but my thoughts on Trump are completely neutral .
For me it was a transaction between myself and the artist . "

If you have nt made your Venmo transactions private yet , do it now .
The payment app reveals a massive amount of private details about users lives by default , a report released Tuesday showed .
The project , created by Berlin - based coder and privacy researcher Hang Do Thi Duc , examined 207,984,218 public transactions posted on Venmo in 2017 .
She found she was able to paint detailed pictures of users lives based on information available to anybody . "
Many products that we use on a daily basis make it more difficult than it should be to protect our privacy , our most personal information , " she said . "
When it comes to money , privacy by design is of greater importance and higher demand . "
Venmo , which is owned by Paypal PYPL , -3.01 % , makes transactions viewable on a public feed by default unless users change preferences to make them visible only to friends or only to the two parties involved in a transaction .
The amount of money spent by users is not visible publicly , but the text , emojis , and time stamps visible on transactions say a lot , Do Thi Duc said .
Venmo told MarketWatch users have control over how much they share on the app . "
The safety and privacy of Venmo users and their information is one of our highest priorities , " a spokesman said . "
Our users trust us with their money and personal information , and we take this responsibility and applicable privacy laws very seriously . "
Do Thi Duc detailed the life stories and personal habits of several users with data gleaned in her analysis .
In one case , she was able to determine that two users who frequently made transactions with one another were a married couple .
They owned a car and a dog they had recently taken to the vet .
They shop for groceries weekly at Walmart WMT , -2.48 % They re paying off a loan , and get utilities from San Diego Gas & Electric .
They most frequently order pizza when eating out .
Another Venmo user she tracked sells food from a cart at a University of California campus .
She could see more than 8,000 of the persons public transactions over the course of the year , and saw that elote ( a corn dish ) was the most popular .
One couple she followed frequently argued and threatened to break up through Venmo transactions , using feuding captions like , " You do nt love me , " and , " I m waiting for the sugar daddy . "
Ethereum co - founder : Blockchain - based wallet could end need for banks Venmos public application programming interface ( API ) lets anybody see public transactions , and it has been criticized in the past for privacy issues .
One project called Vicemo displays public payments with references to drugs , sex and alcohol in an ongoing feed .
The app has also been used by savvy users to find out if a romantic partner is cheating or if an ex - boyfriend is seeing someone new .
These transactions are nt only visible to the public , they are also used by marketers .
Venmo states in its privacy policy that it shares user data " for everyday business purposes , for marketing purposes , for joint marketing with other companies . "
Venmo also shares " information about your transactions and experiences " with its affiliates .
Venmos public - by - default feature was the target of an investigation of the Federal Trade Commission , which accused Venmo in 2017 of " misleading " users about the fact that they needed to change two separate privacy settings to make their transactions completely private .
The company reached a settlement with the FTC .
A company spokesman previously told MarketWatch that users now have three options for controlling who can see their payments .
It should be easier to make these changes , Do Thi Duc said , and it is the responsibility of Venmo to fix these privacy issues rather than rely on users to change settings themselves . "
I believe this could be designed better , " she said . "
Why include all this information , when essentially the only interesting part is the message ?
If you -- as a company -- actually care about your users and their privacy you would ask this kind of questions . "
A Venmo spokeswoman told the Guardian newspaper that the safety of users was of the utmost priority . "
Like on other social networks , Venmo users can choose what they want to share on the Venmo public feed , " she said .
To make your Venmo account private , go to " settings " and click " privacy . "
Under the privacy setting , users can select default privacy setting for all future payments to " private . "
There is also an option to make all past transactions private as well .
Mark Weinstein , founder and chief executive officer of privacy - oriented social media platform MeWe , suggests making these changes or deleting the app completely . "
With just a little snooping , anyone and everyone can find out what you are doing on Venmo -- and that s really creepy , " he said . "
It is certainly quite a shock when you discover that your sale or purchase of corn on the cob -- or illegal purchase of something else -- and everything in between , is public . "
If you like traveling in style , it could make sense to get a travel credit card that offers luxurious perks , such as free cocktails for when you 're waiting to board your flight or complimentary stays at five - star hotels .
To determine the best elite card overall , CNBC Make It analyzed 35 of the most popular travel cards in the U.S. Using a sample budget based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , we estimated how much money each card would save the typical American , as well as frequent travelers , after five years .
We also evaluated the ease of use of each card , plus notable features and potential downsides including annual fees and interest rates .
While the Capital One Venture card was our No .
1 choice for the best travel card overall , another card stood out as the best choice for travelers whose priority is luxury .
Our pick for the best travel credit card if you love luxury The Platinum card offers Priority Pass Select lounge membership and complimentary access to the highly regarded American Express Centurion lounges , plus Delta Sky Club access when you fly directly with Delta .
As for hotel perks , cardholders receive free nights and other benefits with the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program , and they qualify for Gold elite status with Hilton and Starwood hotels .
The card does require a hefty $ 550 annual fee but users receive up to $ 200 per year in Uber credits and $ 200 in annual airline credits which you can use to check a bag or purchase in - flight refreshments .
For rewards , the card offers five points on all hotels and airlines booked with American Express Travel , two points on other travel bookings through the site , such as vacation packages , and one point on all other purchases .
When you sign up , you receive 60,000 bonus points as long as you spend $ 5,000 in the first three months .
That 's $ 600 toward travel or gift cards .
The Platinum card is technically a charge card , which is similar to a credit card , except with a charge card you have to pay off your balance in full each month or you 'll be hit with a late fee .
If you want to have the option to carry a balance on the Platinum card , you have to enroll in the card 's Pay Over Time feature .
If you care more about savings than perks , there may be better premier options , such as the Barclays Arrival Premier World Elite Mastercard : With a modest $ 150 annual fee and an unlimited two miles per dollar on all purchases , that card can earn you more over five years , according to our analysis .
Or you might consider the Chase Sapphire Reserve , our runner - up choice for the best travel card overall , which promises a sign - up bonus amounting to $ 750 when redeemed for travel , plus , like the Platinum card , the option to transfer points to partner reward programs .
But five points back on all hotels and flights can add up if you travel a lot .
And if you 're looking for the most comprehensive set of premier benefits , the Platinum Card from American Express is the way to go .
American Express Platinum at a glance : Rewards : Five points on flights booked with airlines or American Express Travel and five points on hotels booked with American Express Travel ; two points on other travel expenses booked through American Express ; one point on all other purchases : Five points on flights booked with airlines or American Express Travel and five points on hotels booked with American Express Travel ; two points on other travel expenses booked through American Express ; one point on all other purchases Annual fee : $ 550 : $ 550 Bonus : 60,000 points if you spend $ 5,000 within first three months : 60,000 points if you spend $ 5,000 within first three months Variable APR : 14.74 to 25.74 percent based on your credit score for those who enroll in Pay Over Time : 14.74 to 25.74 percent based on your credit score for those who enroll in Pay Over Time Estimated five - year return for average travelers : $ 280 to $ 970 : $ 280 to $ 970 Estimated five - year return for frequent travelers : $ 790 to $ 1,820 : $ 790 to $ 1,820 How you redeem points : Transfer points to a partner rewards program , book travel directly through American Express Travel , donate to a non - profit or redeem for cash or merchandise at a lower rate : Transfer points to a partner rewards program , book travel directly through American Express Travel , donate to a non - profit or redeem for cash or merchandise at a lower rate Notable perks : $ 200 in annual airline fee credits ; $ 200 in Uber credits ; Up to $ 100 for Global Entry or TSA Precheck ; Centurion Lounge access ; Global Lounge Collection ; Fine Hotels & Resorts benefits How we decided To determine which card offers the best deal for travelers who want luxury , CNBC Make It compiled a list of 35 highly rated travel credit cards .
We vetted each card based on its reward offers , introductory and eventual APR , annual fee , bonus , recommended credit score , late fee , balance transfer fee , foreign transaction fee , redemption rates , transfer options , customer reviews and extra perks .
We then estimated how much money each card would save the typical American and a frequent traveler after one year , two years and five years .
Our assessment heavily weighs the five - year return to avoid a large sign - up bonus skewing the results .
We also assume that most people want a great card that they can stick with for years , especially since bouncing from card to card can be bad for your credit score .
To estimate the return , we used expenditure data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to make a sample budget broken down by average annual spending in categories like gas ( $ 1,909 ) , groceries ( $ 4,049 ) , dining out ( $ 3,154 ) and general purchases ( $ 12,833 ) .
The general spending category includes shopping , entertainment , public transit , vehicle expenses other than gas , some household costs and travel expenses like airline fares ( $ 403 ) , hotels ( $ 475 ) and vehicle rentals ( $ 64 ) .
For the average - traveler budget , travel expenses were drawn directly from the BLS .
For the frequent - traveler budget , we revised these categories upward based on the expert recommendation that you should spend at least $ 8,600 on travel and dining each year to make getting a travel card worth it .
We increased the expenses proportionally to the average budget , estimating annual airfare costs of $ 2,300 , hotel costs of $ 2,700 and vehicle rentals of $ 400 .
If you use the IRS tax withholding calculator , you might want to run your results by your accountant before you adjust the amount of income taxes that are pulled from your paycheck .
That s because user error and failure to consider your state and local tax loads could lead to you making incorrect adjustments to your withholding . "
There is no question that if you can have some good information about your situation , the calculator will work much better for you and you will get a more accurate readout of where you are , " said Eric L. Smith , a spokesman for the IRS . "
We suggest that once you do it , go in again in a few months and see if you re current and on target , " he said .
The IRS , which has just released its , also has new tax , reflecting changes stemming from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act .
The new legislation roughly doubled the standard deduction , did away with personal exemptions and trimmed individual income tax rates .
Filers are supposed to use the new withholding calculator to determine what , if any , changes they should make at work to ensure that they re paying just the right amount of tax at every pay period .
Just make sure you recheck your data with your accountant before you make any changes , tax experts say . "
A lot of people do nt understand the line items and you have to make sure you re accounting for that accurately , " said certified financial planner Debbie J. Freeman , a CPA and director of financial planning at Peak Financial Advisors in Denver . "
Unless you understand taxes , its not something you should fully rely on , " she said .
If you re planning for retirement , you re probably thinking about how much you ll need , how long the money will last , and how much you can safely take out each year .
You recognize that in retirement there will be a balancing act between spending on current needs while also preserving enough for your later years .
You might say , " Sure , I d like to leave something to the kids .
But first I want to make sure were comfortable . "
Or , if you have a sense of humor , with a wink and smile you might say " I plan to let the last check bounce ! "
That may be what people who are nearing retirement say , but research shows its not what they do .
Instead , all - too - often , retirees use simplified rules of thumb to determine how much to take out each year .
The result is their assets continue to increase in retirement , and this increased wealth is passed along to beneficiaries .
There s nothing wrong with passing along more , of course .
But what if there was a way to enjoy more of what you ve accumulated along the way ?
Not spending more just for the sake of spending , but using funds to spend more time with family and help those you care about while you are around to enjoy the impact of doing so .
There is a way to do this while still preserving enough for your later years , but it does nt happen by following a rule of thumb .
When it comes to retirement , 60s are the new 50s Take the popularized " 4 % rule " as an example .
Its a rule of thumb that says you can withdraw 4 % of your portfolio value each year in retirement without incurring a substantial risk of running out of money .
Using this rule , for every $ 100,000 you have , you d withdraw $ 4,000 a year .
This rule is based on solid academic research .
That s great .
We all like historical research , particularly when it comes to serious topics like making sure you do nt outlive your savings .
But the research used a " set it and forget it " approach -- it did not account for the ability to adjust behavior along the way .
In other words , basing your retirement withdrawals on such a rule is like planning your finances based on your situation at age 25 , and then never again adjusting the plan .
Read : Its harder than you think to spend down your 401(k ) in retirement Unless we see the return of a Great Depression era , followers of the 4 % rule " will most commonly just leave a huge amount of money left over , " says Michael Kitces in his research piece , entitled " How Has The 4 % Rule Held Up Since The Tech Bubble And The 2008 Financial Crisis ? "
In addition to being incredibly conservative , the 4 % rule does not consider other sources of income you have and the timing of when each source begins .
For example , some may retire at age 60 , but not have access to Social Security or a pension until a few years later .
Why scrimp by only withdrawing 4 % of your portfolio while waiting for Social Security ?
It often makes more sense to withdraw more than 4 % during that window of time -- yet many retirees wo nt do this because the popularized rule of thumb has made them fearful that they ll run out of money if they do nt follow the rule each year .
In fact , when done properly , often the opposite is true .
Customized withdrawal plans increase the odds your savings will last longer .
Money is a tool we can use , and we ca nt take it with us .
It allows us to contribute to family , to education , to causes and communities that matter to us .
Instead of using a " set it and forget it " strategy that forces you to live like you re in a recession from day one of retirement , you can build a flexible approach .
Then you use a set of diagnostics to determine when to make changes .
Just like engineers follow defined formulas to build bridges that we feel safe driving across , there are mathematical concepts that can be applied to test your retirement income plan each year so you feel safe it will continue to work .
Such testing includes things like a Monte Carlo analysis , a way to simulate random future market conditions , calculating your minimum required return that it takes to make your plan work through life expectancy , and using present value formulas to compare your scheduled future withdrawals to what you have now .
If you have nt heard of these concepts , that s understandable .
Much of the financial industry still focuses on investment products and simplified rules .
That makes perfect sense .
Its hard to condense years worth of studying , research and experience into a single consumer article .
Its much easier to write about a rule of thumb or sensationalize the latest stock market gyration .
If you like the concept of a dynamic withdrawal plan but are nt comfortable implementing it yourself , you can hire a professional .
You have to know what to look for though .
Retirement income professionals use defined formulas , such as those taught in the Retirement Management Advisor courses offered by the Investments & Wealth Institute .
Be cautious of a financial adviser who uses a rule of thumb to determine your retirement withdrawal amounts .
There is nothing unprofessional about using a rule of thumb to set broad , general expectations .
But when you are at the point where you will begin withdrawals in the next few years , its time to throw out generalizations .
Retirement is the biggest financial decision you ll make and you need a customized plan , not a rule of thumb .
If you ve been pining for an epic international vacation but are feeling strapped for cash , look for cities where the U.S. dollar is the strongest .
Over half of Americans plan on going on vacation this summer , according to a recent survey by Bankrate .
The median amount they plan to spend is $ 1,000 , with less than a quarter saying they ll spend over $ 2,000 .
For larger families , the cost of a getaway is steeper ; a family of four spends $ 4,000 on average .
For those looking to save , there are many ways to explore the world without breaking the bank . "
The biggest thing is to stick to a budget in advance , " said Katie Wudel , deputy editor of content at GOBankingRates.com .
If you ve visited a restaurant in recent months , there s a good chance you ve learned about the new enemy that has emerged in the fight against plastic waste : the single - use plastic straw .
Starbucks SBUX , -0.89 % is among the U.S. companies that has committed to eliminating all single - use plastic straws in its stores by 2020 .
Instead , drinks that usually come with straws will have strawless lids or straws made from some type of alternative material .
The company is nt alone .
The cruise line Royal Caribbean RCL , -7.95 % has also stopped using plastic straws .
And several cities , including Seattle , Miami Beach and San Luis Obispo , Calif. , have announced their own bans or limits on plastic straws .
See also : Starbucks and McDonalds plastic straw removal will go down well with millennials " The death of the plastic straw means better life for marine animals , " said Jessica Dutton , the director of special projects at the University of Southern Californias Dornsife Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies .
April 22 is Earth Day , a worldwide day of awareness to reduce waste and protect the environment .
This is nt the first time companies and cities have tried to promote such efforts .
Heres a brief history of disposable packaging : The tide turns against cotton buds and plastic bottles The European Union has seemingly gone a step further than the U.S. when it comes to plastics : It has proposed banning additional plastic products including cotton buds ( like the ones used for cleaning ears ) and balloon sticks .
The EUs vice president said the organization would nt ban those items completely , but companies would have to take steps to make them out of sustainable materials .
And the latest push to ban plastic products does nt end there .
Environmental advocates say bottled water is too expensive and unnecessary .
There are several petitions on Change.org calling for the ban of plastic water bottles ( though they have few signatures ) , and the town of Concord , Mass. , banned sales of plastic water bottles smaller than one liter in 2013 .
Sales of plastic bottles of water have also continued to grow in the U.S. In the four decades since the launch of Perrier water in the U.S. , consumption of bottled water surged 2,700 % , from 354 million gallons in 1976 to 11.7 billion gallons in 2015 , according to the International Bottled Water Association .
Bottled water has the smallest environmental footprint of all packaged beverages , said Jill Culora , a spokeswoman for the International Bottled Water Association .
Bottled water containers are 100 % recyclable , she said . "
In addition , bottled water containers are the most common item in curbside recycling programs , recycled at a rate of 53.9 % , " she added .
But right now in the U.S. , the focus remains on straws . "
Straws are a great place to start because they re something everyone uses , " Dutton of USC said . "
Its not about straws alone , but recognizing how prevalent single - use plastics are in our lives and reducing where we can . "
The early days of paper cups The first paper plates and cups were invented in the early 1900s , according to historians .
In 1907 , a lawyer in Boston developed the single - use paper cup , after scientists realized that diseases such as cholera and diphtheria were spreading because people were sharing communal cups at public water fountains .
The lawyer , Lawrence Luellen , and his brother - in - law moved to new York in 1910 and produced their product , the Health Kup .
Their company eventually became Dixie Cup , a brand many recognize today .
Paper cups continued to grow in popularity .
The market for U.S. paper cups and paper plates reached $ 20.5 billion in 2017 and is expected to grow to $ 21.7 billion in 2023 , according to a report from IMARC Group , a market research firm .
Though many paper cups are made from renewable resources like wood or bamboo , they re not necessarily an eco - friendly choice .
Some are coated with substances that make them impossible to recycle , so they end up at the landfill .
Plastic products were de rigueur in the 1950s .
Getty Images Plastic took off after World War II The production of plastic really took off during World War II , according to the Science History Institute , a nonprofit organization based in Philadelphia .
During the war , plastic production in the U.S. increased by 300 % .
And plastic began to be used for more purposes .
Single - use food packaging products -- which also include those made from materials like aluminum -- became widespread in the 1960s , according to the Foodservice Packaging Institute , a trade group based in Falls Church , Va. At the same time , scientists started to alert the public about the dangers of using too many plastics and other forms of pollution .
The Rachel Carson book " Silent Spring , " published in 1962 , created more awareness of the effects of chemical pesticides , and a 1969 oil spill off the California coast raised alarm about the health of waterways .
Plastic debris was first spotted in the ocean in the 1960s , according to the Science History Institute .
By the 1970s and 1980s , plastic had a damaged reputation , the Science History Institute said .
Today , American consumers discard around 33.6 million tons of plastic each year , but only 6.5 % of that is recycled and 7.7 % is combusted in waste - to - energy facilities , according to Columbia Universitys Earth Center .
Where disposable containers stand now Despite this , the use of plastic has continued to grow .
The share of plastics in municipal solid waste ( by mass ) increased from less than 1 % in 1960 to more than 10 % by 2005 in middle- and high - income countries , according to a report by environmental researchers Roland Geyer , Jenna Jambeck and Kara Lavender Law .
But some restaurants have made changes .
In 1990 , McDonalds MCD , -0.17 % announced it would phase out its foam containers , as part of a push to be more environmentally sustainable .
The restaurant chain had worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to look at how it handles its disposable products .
Earlier this year , the fast - food giant said it would stop using foam packaging entirely by the end of 2018 .
Entire cities have also banned foam containers , in an effort to cut down on non - recyclable materials , including New York City in 2015 .
Single - use packaging can be more sanitary than reusing containers , said Lynn Dyer , a spokeswoman for the Foodservice Packaging Institute , a trade group .
But making more packaging compostable or recyclable can help with waste , she said .
How socially responsible investing transforms traditional portfolios Plastic bags are another target Plastic bags have also become a target : California became the first state to ban retailers from handing them out in 2014 .
The most populous counties in Hawaii also prohibit non - biodegradable plastic bags .
And several cities , including Austin , Boston , Chicago and Seattle , have also banned them .
At the end of their life , only 5 % of reusable plastic bags are recycled in the U.S. , according to a 2011 report by California State University , Chico , and Clemson University .
That s the same recycling rate for single - use plastic bags .
By 2050 , there will be more plastic by weight in the worlds oceans than fish , according to a 2018 report by the New York State Plastic Bag Task Force . "
Plastic bags also interfere with wastewater treatment plants , pose a threat to fish and wildlife , and break down into microplastics , " it said .
However , some solutions to the waste have their own holes : Some reusable bags need to be used over 100 times before they re better for the environment than single - use plastic bags .
Polyethylene bags need to be used four times , a polypropylene bag must be used at least 11 times , and a cotton bag must be used at least 131 times , according to a study by the U.K. Environment Agency .
And some reusable bags are shipped from halfway around the world . (

In a new episode of Jada Pinkett Smith 's " Red Table Talk " Facebook Watch series , the actress is characteristically candid when discussing her history of addictions , including sex , alcohol and fitness . "
My sort of addictions jump , they jump around , " she says in the episode . "
When I was younger , I definitely think I had a sex addiction of some kind , yes , that everything could be fixed by sex . "
As for her struggles with drinking , " I remember reaching a rock bottom that time I was in the house by myself and I had those two bottles of wine and was going for the third bottle , " she says . "
And I was like , ' Now hold up .
You re in this house by yourself going onto your third bottle of wine ?
You might have a problem . ' " "
So I went cold turkey , " she continued . "
That s the thing about me , I can go cold turkey .
I am a binger , and I always have to watch myself and I can just get obsessed with things .
Its not what you re doing but how you re with it .
Why you re doing it .
Its the behavior that s attached to it because if you want to have a lot of sex , that s great , but why are you having all that sex ?
That s what you ve got to look at . "
Smith 's mother Adrienne Banfield - Jones , who frequently co - hosts the show , also joined the episode to discuss the details of her 20-year heroin addiction for the first time publicly . "
Red Table Talk " premiered in May as a weekly Facebook Watch talk show bringing together three generations of women -- Smith 's daughter Willow also occasionally joins her and Banfield - Jones for episodes -- for " a series of candid conversations with family and friends . "
Previous guests have included Tiffany Haddish and Gabrielle Union , with Facebook ordering an additional 13 episodes to premiere this fall .
Smith previously spoke about her sexual history in a May " Red Table Talk " episode with her daughter Willow Smith , including a self - proclaimed masturbation addiction when she was younger . "
My grandmother taught me about self - pleasuring because she wanted me to know that that pleasure was from me , " she said . "
She did n't want me to fall into the hands of a man and , if he gave me pleasure , to think that that was him .
And she taught me at 9 .
At 9 ! " "
I think by your age I gave myself multiples first , multiple orgasms .
I did , " she continued . "
I was really into it at one point .
Just because I was in an exploration state and I was abstaining from men .
And I actually think I went through kind of an addiction , too , with it ... And then one day I was like , ' Enough .
You 're having five orgasms a day . ' "

In an effort to make your resume stand out from the pack it can be tempting to stretch the truth .
But exaggerating on your resume is an extremely bad idea , says Elaine Varelas , a managing partner at career consulting firm Keystone Partners .
Not only will you find it difficult to back up falsified claims in an interview setting , she says , but hiring managers will eventually find out the truth when they check in with your references . "
Your goal is to present yourself in the best light while being honest , " Varelas tells CNBC Make It .
To ensure that you 're presenting all fact and no fiction , she says to remove these five common white lies from your resume : 1 .
Altering your job title One mistake people often make is changing their title to a more senior role , especially if they took on a substantial amount of work , says Varelas .
But if the title that you were given is " assistant , " she explains , then its inaccurate to change it to " associate " -- even if you were doing associate - level work .
Instead , Varelas recommends detailing your experience in the cover letter or resume to show that you were taking on the same level of work as more senior employees .
The same advice goes for job titles that are specific to your organization , such as " assistant , level four . "
You can note who you reported to on your resume , to give the title some meaning , says Varelas , but refrain from entirely changing the title or inflating your position .
2 .
Listing an unfinished college degree Applicants will sometimes include a college degree without the graduation date or list completed coursework for a degree that was never awarded , says Varelas .
But if your degree is still in progress or you re taking a semester hiatus , you must be upfront about that .
Varelas says to always provide the expected graduation date for a degree that s in the works .
If you took courses toward a degree that you do n't plan on finishing , then only include the classes that you took , especially if they relate to the position for which you 're applying , she says .
3 .
Overstating results Do n't say that you grew sales by 100 percent unless the numbers are significant .
There 's a big different between a $ 10 to $ 20 jump and $ 1 million to $ 2 million jump , says Varelas .
To avoid overstating results , whether that s an increase in productivity or cost - cutting measures , remove percentages and words like " doubled " or " tripled " from your resume .
Replace these qualitative words with more concrete numbers , says Varelas , to give the recruiter a clear understanding of your outcomes .
4 .
Acting like you led a project or team Be very straightforward about what your role entailed on a project , says Varelas .
Many times , job seekers will make it seem like they spearheaded a major assignment , when in actuality , they assisted on a small portion of it .
A better strategy is to be extremely forthcoming about the assistance you provided and how your workhelped to move the project forward , she says .
Another mistake to shy away from is saying that you managed people when you did nt , Varelas adds .
Even if you oversaw junior employees on certain assignments , do nt say you managed them unless they were your direct reports .
5 .
Tweaking your employment dates Job seekers tend to exaggerate the dates they held a position at a company , says Varelas .
They 'll add a few extra months to hit a certain mark , like one year of employment , or to hide gaps in their work history .
This can be problematic if your employer performs a background check , she says , or asks for a letter of employment from a previous job , which typically includes your start date .
As minor as this may sound , when a hiring manager notices inconsistencies , no matter how slight , it calls your entire resume and qualifications into question .
Its better to be upfront from the very beginning , says Varelas .

In case you missed it while enjoying your Fourth of July barbecue , a new dance craze broke out across social media , inspired by the Drake song ' In My Feelings .
As one might expect given the involvement of an artist without whom no prep basketball warm up playlist is complete , some of the most high profile basketball recruits of both the 2018 and 2018 class got involved .
Filming their dance routines on cell phones and posting them to social media networks with the hashtag # DoTheShiggy and # InMyFeelings , incoming Duke hoopsters Tre Jones and top 2018 recruit R.J. Barrett offered up the following : Tre Jones , the younger brother of former Apple Valley ( Minn. ) and Duke star turned Timberwolves guard Tyus Jones , was certainly the more active half of the duos Shiggy throwdown , with Barrett more grooving along with the beat .
Yet neither of the Duke players could compare to the effort of 2019 recruit Noah Farrakhan , who absolutely killed the Shiggy routine while rocking a very summer outfit of aquamarine - esque shorts , pink shirt and a Gucci sweatshirt .

In his State of the Union address , President Trump said " there has never been a better time to start living the American Dream . "
But the new 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its accompanying report says that is nt so for low - income Americans . "
The system is , by just about all measures , stacked against those with low incomes and low wealth for the benefit of the wealthiest , " says the report from the nonpartisan but left - leaning Prosperity Now nonprofit , which provides research and recommendations regarding Americans with limited incomes .
One example : low - income people are ineligible for federal programs such as SNAP ( food stamps ) and TANF ( Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ) if they amass " even modest savings , " the report noted .
Prosperity Now calls policies like this " a roadblock on the path to saving . "
What the 2018 Prosperity Now scorecard found The 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its report , Whose Bad Choices ?
How Policy Precludes Prosperity and What We Can Do About It , also make the argument that the U.S. economic system and policies of the Trump administration and Congress are stacked against people of color . "
We ve heard more rhetoric lately about [ low - income ] people making ' bad choices or being ' irresponsible with money and that s been the direction policy has been going , said Kasey Wiedrich , director of applied research at Prosperity Now . "
We wanted to attack that . "
One example of the rhetoric : Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) recently said lower - income Americans " are just spending every darn penny they have whether its on booze or women or movies . "
Sen. Chuck Grassley .
Getty In reality , however , the Prosperity Now report said , " the dominant narrative about low - wealth people is nothing but a series of myths . "
Poor choices , the analysts there say , are nt why people are poor .
Read : Booze , women or movies ?
What taxpayers are really spending their money on ... The 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard reviewed 115 outcome and policy measures for all 50 states and the District of Columbia to see how well residents are faring in five categories , and how much progress each state has made in adopting policies in them " toward building a path to prosperity for all its residents . "
The categories : financial assets and income ; businesses and jobs ; homeownership and housing ; health care and education .
Best and worst states in the scorecard The top five states , starting with the best : Vermont , New Hampshire , Hawaii , Minnesota and Utah .
The bottom states , starting with the worst : Mississippi , Louisiana , Georgia , Nevada and New Mexico and Alabama , which tied .
Wiedrich said the states with the lowest Scorecard rankings typically have " the highest rates of low - wage jobs , lower credit scores and households struggling with incomes . "
Also , she added , these states tend to " have less of a safety net . "
As a result , " a financial emergency may hit their residents harder . "
Low - wage jobs are a chief reason so many low - income Americans have trouble making ends meet these days , according to Wiedrich .
This years Scorecard found that nearly one in four jobs are in low - wage occupations -- ones that do nt pay enough to keep families above the federal poverty line .
And , Prosperity Nows researchers say , even though unemployment has been cut in half since its peak in 2010 ( from 9.6 % to 4.5 % ) , the rate of low - wage jobs has decreased by just two percentage points since 2013 ( to 25.6 % ) and is still higher than in 2010 ( when the rate was 21.5 % ) .
Weidrich concedes that " there s been an incremental improvement in a lot of economic measures compared to a year ago . "
In addition to the falling unemployment rate ( just 3 % for people 55 + ) , there are the rising stock market ( until the past few days ) , increasing wages -- up 2.9 % in the past year -- rising median net worth and a drop in the number of Americans without health insurance ( something which may change with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate ) .
What to do in your 40s to retire a millionaire Some economic improvements , but ' not a panacea for all But , Wiedrich is quick to add , " its still not a panacea for all . "
Although the median net worth has been rising more for people of color than for whites , the unemployment rate is still more than twice as high for blacks ( 7.7 % ) than for whites ( 3.5 % ) .
And roughly half of renters ( 46 % of white renters and 54 % of renters of color ) are what Prosperity Now calls " cost - burdened " -- they spend more than 30 % of their income on housing costs . "
That lowers their ability to save to buy a home , " said Wiedrich . "
The homeownership figure in America has not really moved . "
Do nt miss : Many older Americans are living a desperate , nomadic life Prosperity Now argues that the 2017 tax law and a wave of deregulation by the Trump administration and Congress are helping the wealthiest Americans and corporations far more than people with low incomes .
The groups report cites a Tax Policy Center estimate that the new tax law will translate to a $ 51,140 tax cut for the wealthiest 1 % of households , but families earning less than $ 25,000 in 2018 will see " a mere $ 60 in tax savings . "
House Speaker Paul Ryan ( R - Wis . )
just took heat for tweeting about a Pennsylvania high - school secretary who was pleasantly surprised her paycheck rose $ 1.50 a week due to the tax cut .
What the Prosperity Now report does nt mention , however , is that the new tax law also doubled the standard deduction ( to $ 24,000 for married couples filing jointly ) and doubled the child - care tax credit ( to as much as $ 2,000 per qualifying child ) .
Both changes stand to help low - income Americans .
What the debt figures say For the first time , this years Prosperity Now Scorecard included data on Americans levels of personal debt and their debt management .
Both have been improving , overall -- but there are a few debt trends going in the wrong direction .
On the plus side , median credit card debt fell 6.5 % from $ 2,397 in the second quarter of 2010 to $ 2,241 in the second quarter of 2017 , adjusted for inflation .
And the percentage of consumers with delinquent credit card debt decreased from 11.7 % of borrowers in 2010 to 8.4 % in 2017 .
But student loan debt is a growing problem : Median student loan debt increased by 21.4 % between 2010 and 2017 , from $ 14,588 to $ 17,711 .
The percentage of student loan borrowers who are delinquent ( 15.8 % ) is nearly twice the percentage of delinquent credit card borrowers .
Among those over 55 with student loan debt , 12.3 % are severely delinquent .
Also , the report noted , many households of color are dealing with debt issues . "
Student loan debt typically haunts students of color for much longer than other students , " it said .
Households of color are also more likely to be turned down for loans and are more vulnerable to fees and predatory products than white households .
An Urban Institute study of 60 U.S. cities discovered that the predominately white areas had a median credit score 80 points higher than in predominately non - white neighborhoods , which can cost families of color $ 100 or more each month on a mortgage .
And the Federal Reserve Boards Survey of Consumer Finances found that African - American households are twice as likely as white household to be late on credit payments .
All in all , Wiedrich said , Americans with low wealth generally are nt reaping the benefits of todays humming economy .
Their wages are nt keeping up with the rising costs of housing and health care .
Also , " many are dealing with income volatility , which makes it hard to plan and to make ends meet , " said Wiedrich .
States expanding the earned income tax credit A few states , however , have recently adopted policies -- or are working to do so -- that could help low - income people on the path to prosperity .
For example , Hawaii , Montana and South Carolina established state earned income tax credits ; California and Illinois expanded their credits to cover more working families .
These tax credits , like the federal anti - poverty one , put money in the pockets of low- and moderate - income working people so they can keep more of what they earn .
Currently , 29 states have a state earned income tax credit .
Helping Americans save for retirement And , although the Trump administration and Congress recently made it tougher for states to set up retirement plans for residents whose employers do nt offer them -- a " short - sighted " policy , Weidrich said -- a few states are creating them anyway .
California , Connecticut , Illinois , Maryland and Oregon have done this ; Massachusetts , New Jersey , Vermont and Washington , the Prosperity Now report said , " are pursuing similar strategies . "
That could be especially helpful for low - income people ; 77 % of the lowest - earning workers lack access to an employer - provided retirement plan . '
Lifting citizens to prosperity President Trump declared in his State of the Union speech that " we can lift our citizens ... from poverty to prosperity . "
But , Prosperity Now maintains , to make that happen , more states and federal policymakers need to do more -- especially now , when times are good for so many .
See : Got $ 1 million to retire ?
Heres how long it will last in every U.S. state " At some point , the economy will encounter another downswing or recession and those who are not benefiting much from todays economic gains will be hardest hit , " said Wiedrich .

In the battle to offer more competitive smartphone plans , Sprint has just unveiled two that hopes it will have it running ahead of the pack .
Following recently revised plans from AT&T and Verizon , Sprint is introducing a pair of new unlimited offerings that they hope will take on similar plans from both of those rivals , plus T - Mobile .
The new plans , which go into effect on Friday , are " Unlimited Plus , " priced at $ 70 per month for one line , $ 120 for two lines and $ 180 for four lines ; and " Unlimited Basic , " which costs $ 60 per month for one line , $ 100 for two and $ 140 for four lines .
More Money : Students are n't the only ones crushed by school debt More Tech : Cord cutter de ja vu : Streaming channels are looking more like those hated cable TV bundles More Tech : In less than a minute , four thieves steal over $ 27,000 worth of goods from an Apple store The new offerings are cheaper than the latest options from AT&T , Verizon and T - Mobile , depending on the level of service .
Those plans run between $ 70 and $ 75 per month for one line of the cheapest unlimited option and between $ 190 to $ 240 per month for four lines of the priciest data plans at each carrier .
Sprint , the nation 's fourth - largest carrier , said Thursday that the new plans will replace its current " Unlimited Freedom " offering .
Both new plans , however , will keep perks such as access to Hulu and free text and data in over 185 destinations around the world .
Those who pony up for " Unlimited Plus " will also get a premium subscription to the Tidal music service for each Sprint line they have ( regularly $ 9.99 per month ) , more high - speed mobile hotspot data ( 15 GB of 4 G LTE data on Plus instead of 500 MB on Basic ) , more high - speed data in Canada and Mexico ( 10 GB of 4 G LTE data instead of 5 GB ) and full HD video streaming over the carrier 's 4 G LTE network .
For existing Sprint customers , however , the new plan does n't represent too much of an upgrade over the current " Unlimited Freedom " plan that they are replacing , though those who do n't care about HD streaming or mobile hotspot data will be able to save a little bit per month .
Under the " Unlimited Freedom " plan , users paid $ 60 for one line , $ 100 for two or $ 160 for four lines .
They got Hulu access with full HD video streaming over Sprint 's network , 10 GB of mobile hotspot data , a six - month trial of Tidal and 5 GB of high - speed data in Canada and Mexico .
Sprint users happy with their current plans will not need to change them . "
The industry evolves , " says Dow Draper , Sprint 's chief commercial officer . "
We did quite a bit of consumer research to figure out how we can make plans more meaningful to customers , " noting how not everyone wants the add - ons like Tidal or HD streaming or needs a large amount of mobile hotspot data . "
We see it as a bit of a platform that we call ' unlimited for all , ' " says Draper . "
There 's unlimited for people who maybe do n't need all these features and unlimited for people who want a lot more features . "
Both new and existing customers can switch to these plans , with Sprint offering a limited - time promotion for " switchers " of an additional $ 20 off per line to new customers who sign up for " Unlimited Plus " and bring their own phone with them when they switch or purchase a new device from Sprint at full price .
While not as aggressive as Sprint 's recent $ 15 per month switcher offer that the company offered for one week in June , the promotion does bring the price of the " Plus " plan down to $ 50 per month for one line , $ 80 for two lines or $ 100 for four lines for those who switch over from a rival network .
Military discount In addition to the new " Plus " and " Basic " plans , Sprint is adding a new discount for military members and their families .
Called " Unlimited Military " Sprint is offering members of the military and their families a discount on service .
It has the same $ 60 a month price for a single line as " Unlimited Basic " but drops the price of two lines to $ 80 a month and four lines to $ 100 a month .
The military plan is similar to one that rival -- and potential partner -- T - Mobile has been touting heavily in recent television ads .
Draper , however , says the company was working on introducing a plan like this independently from the companies pending $ 26 billionmerger .
Sprint 's offer is available to active duty , reserve and veterans of all branches of the military .
Though this offer does not include members of law enforcement , Draper says the company is " working on something " for them .

In the lead - up to training camps , USA TODAY Sports will be breaking down the key questions facing each NFL team .
Today , we look at the Chicago Bears : How will the Nagy - Trubisky marriage unfold ?
The Bears have n't had a winning record since 2012 and last reached the playoffs in 2010 .
And with the worst passing offense in the league last year , Chicago struggled to even be competitive .
The hope in the Windy City is that rookie head coach Matt Nagy can not only turn this franchise around but also spark the development of second - year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky in a manner similar to what Sean McVay did for Jared Goff in Los Angeles last year .
However the situation in Philadelphia may offer a more apt comparison .
Like Nagy , Eagles coach Doug Pederson was Kansas City 's offensive coordinator previous to his promotion .
Pederson successfully implemented that playbook with a young passer , Carson Wentz , who probably would 've won the MVP in his sophomore season had he not been injured .
More:2018 NFL training camp previews , questions for all 32 teams More : No pads ?
No problem for ex - Lion Jahvid Best , who retired with head injury More : Arizona Cardinals General Manager Steve Keim arrested on suspicion of DUI over July 4 Such expectations for Trubisky in 2018 are obviously premature , but his production should at least trend upward after Chicago -- Alshon Jeffery was the Bears ' last 1,000-yard receiver in 2014 -- revamped its arsenal by signing wideouts Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel and tight end Trey Burton in free agency before snatching Memphis ' gifted Anthony Miller in the second round of the draft .
Like Wentz , not to mention former Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith , Trubisky is an underrated athlete who should fit well into this scheme , assuming Nagy and those new weapons can help him take the next step after a disappointing rookie season .
Trubisky has touted the energized team 's new culture and a positive vibe emanating from Nagy , 40 , whose persona should better suit this young roster than old school predecessor John Fox 's demeanor did .
Can this defense be elite ?
Chicago 's ongoing struggles to put points on the board have overshadowed a defense that 's steadily improved since coordinator Vic Fangio installed a radically different system to the Cover 2 philosophy the franchise had used for years .
Nagy retained Fangio , whose unit ranked 10th overall last year thanks to unheralded performances from promising youngsters like cornerback Kyle Fuller , safety Adrian Amos and lineman Akiem Hicks .
First - round linebacker Roquan Smith , selected eighth overall in this year 's draft , should add star power even as he takes on the unenviable task of embarking on a trail blazed by the likes of Butkus , Singletary and Urlacher .
Smith 's transition could be eased if his former University of Georgia teammate , Leonard Floyd , bounces back on the edge after his sack total dipped to 4 1/2 in his second NFL season .
Is this team ready to compete in the NFC North ?
Renewed optimism in Chicago is warranted , but internal flaws are n't the only reasons this team has finished in last place four years running .
The Bears play in a brutal division that remains home to legitimate Super Bowl hopefuls in Minnesota and Green Bay now that the Vikings have added quarterback Kirk Cousins while the Packers will get Aaron Rodgers back healthy and could be significantly stronger on defense . "
For us , it 's about not looking too far ahead and just being our own brand of football , playing Chicago Bear football .
It 's just gon na come down to being 1 - 0 each week , controlling what we can control and not looking too far ahead , " Trubisky said on NFL Network last week . "
We 're excited for the challenge , and we 've got a lot of competitive guys on this team .
So I think it just motivates us even more this year that people are overlooking us in this tough division , but it 's only going to make us better moving forward . " * * *

In the lead - up to training camps , USA TODAY Sports will be breaking down the key questions facing each NFL team .
Today , we look at the Dallas Cowboys : Who will step up in the reshuffled receiving corps ?
After the release of Dez Bryant and the retirement of Jason Witten , the Cowboys are now without two pass catchers who accounted for 42.7 % of the team 's targets ( 211 ) and 42 % of its receiving yards ( 1,398 ) .
With no obvious successors to become Dak Prescott 's primary receiver , Dallas coaches have conceded that multiple players will have to make up for the lost production .
Terrance Williams and free - agent signing Allen Hurns are the early leaders to see the most action , but the unit likely will need other players to emerge .
Cole Beasley , who in 2016 led the team with 75 catches , could carve out a substantial role , while trade - acquisition Tavon Austin is being hyped as a hybrid threat out of the backfield and behind the line of scrimmage .
Keep an eye on third - round pick Michael Gallup , who could become one of Prescott 's favorites given his wide catch radius and penchant for creating separation with precise route running .
The outlook at tight end is grim , as Geoff Swaim is the only returning option who had a catch last year after recording two for 2 yards .

Will the run game return to its elite level ?
A fresh start could make a considerable difference for Ezekiel Elliott after the running back spent half of last season battling the NFL in court before serving a six - game suspension stemming from a domestic violence allegation .
With its offensive centerpiece sidelined , Dallas lost its first three games of Elliott 's ban .
The 2016 rushing champion averaged a full yard less per carry ( 4.1 vs. 5.1 ) than he did the previous season , though he still trailed only the Rams ' Todd Gurley and the Chiefs ' Kareem Hunt in 100-yard rushing games with five .
With defenses likely to load up against the run , the burden for rejuvenating the ground game wo n't solely fall to Elliott .
An offensive line led by Pro Bowl selections Tyron Smith , Zack Martin ( freshly signed to a six - year , $ 84 million extension that makes him the NFL 's highest - paid guard ) and Travis Frederick will be counted on to rediscover its dominant 2016 form .
By signing offensive tackle Cameron Fleming and guard Marcus Martin and drafting guard Connor Williams in the second round , Dallas might have afforded itself some flexibility .
Can the linebackers step up and stay healthy ?
Dallas has uncertainty at every level of its defense , but the key to the unit could be how the linebackers fare .
When Sean Lee played a full game last season , the Cowboys were 8 - 2 .
But they went 1 - 5 when their defensive mainstay played only partially or sat out entirely as he was sidelined by a hamstring injury .
Dallas eschewed its offensive needs to use its first draft pick on Leighton Vander Esch from Boise State .
The 6 - 4 , 256-pounder 's versatility could prove critical , though there might be growing pains given he was only a one - year starter .
Jaylon Smith showed great promise after sitting out his rookie season while recovering from a devastating knee injury , and he was able to go throughout the offseason program without using a brace .
But he will have to prove he can handle a more substantial workload after coaches said they observed a drop - off in his performance when he took on a bigger role .
With scant depth after starter Anthony Hitchens signed with the Chiefs , this unit will need to stay healthier than it has in recent seasons .

INDIANAPOLIS - For the past 17 months , Shayne Holland has enjoyed being a tenant at the River Crossing at Keystone apartment complex on the northside of Indianapolis .
He is fond of the friendly neighborhood , the close proximity to his job and the fact that living there puts him just a short walk away from some of his favorite eateries in the city .
But on Friday night , what he expected to be a relaxing evening at his apartment pool turned into a viral on - camera verbal altercation with an off - duty police officer , claims of racial profiling and an apartment manager being placed on administrative leave .
Approached by an off - duty police officer Holland said the incident started after he got done working out at the fitness center of the complex .
He said he was relaxing in a pool chair when an off - duty Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer who was working security approached him and asked him if he lived at the complex .
The name of the off - duty officer was not immediately available . "
I had my headphones when she approached me so I did n't hear her the first time .
When I asked her to repeat herself , she asked if I lived in the neighborhood .
I said yes , " Holland said . "
When she asked where I lived , I said I do n't know you and you have n't identified yourself , so I 'm not just going to give you my address . "
Holland said he then presented his complex - issued key , which grants him access to the pool area , and told the officer she was welcome to test it and make sure that it worked as proof that he lived there .
The officer then contacted the apartment office to further confirm Holland 's residency .
That is when Holland started using his cellphone to record the interaction .
The apartment manager arrived , and Holland assumed the conversation would end then and there .
He noted that he knows the manager well and had developed a positive rapport with her .
Apartment manager verifies residency In the video , Holland and the manager can be heard casually greeting each other by their first names .
The manager can also be heard telling the officer that Holland does live there .
Holland said he thought the situation would end there . "
I thought the ordeal would be over ... obviously that was n't the case and I was told to leave anyway .
Obviously I was frustrated and I do feel like I was profiled . "
In the video , Holland says that the officer did not approach anyone else at the pool .
The situation escalates from there .
In the video , Holland repeats that he was uncomfortable giving the officer his home address because he does n't know her .
He then asks why he had to leave after the manager confirmed for the officer that he was a resident .
He notes that he 's paid $ 1,600 in rent for the next month . "
Why do I need to give this lady , who I do n't know , my address ? "
Holland asks in the video .
Later he says , " Why do I have to leave my pool ? "
The manager responds by saying that Holland was being told to leave because he refused to answer the officer 's question .
When Holland again holds up his key as his form of proof , the officer can be seen in the video taking it out of Holland 's hand .
Alex Stokely , vice president of Barrett & Stokely , the company that manages River Crossing , told The Indianapolis Star that the apartment manager has been placed on leave in the wake of the videos , which have been viewed more than 30,000 times on Twitter .
Apartment management company initiates internal investigation Stokely added that the company takes these kinds of situation very seriously , and that an internal investigation is being conducted . "
That ( investigation ) includes talking to the employee and talking to the resident to get their point of view , " Stokely said . "
Once we 've finished our internal investigation , we 'll decide if she continues to be an employee or if she 's terminated . "
Stokely also explained that officers were on - site because of an unrelated incident days earlier that involved police being called to the complex in response to a large number of people who did not live at River Crossing using the pool and refusing to leave . "
The police there were to ask everybody there the same question as far as confirming that they did in fact live there or were guests of someone who lived there , " Stokley said .
Holland also said that no call was placed to the IMPD because the officer was at the complex working security while off - duty .
As of Wednesday morning , no formal complaint had been filed against the officer , and IMPD was not investigating the situation .
Latest in a rash of incidents Holland 's case is the latest in a rash of viral incidents that involve black people being confronted or reported to the authorities for ordinary , non - criminal activity .
In each case , the party accused of profiling has earned a nickname to identify them on social media .
The Indianapolis incident follows " ID Adam " in North Carolina who questioned a black woman and her son about using a pool and demanded identification ; " Pool Patrol Paula " in South Carolina who is accused of striking a 15-year - old black teen and telling him he did n't belong at a pool ; " Permit Patty " in California who threatened to call the police on an 8-year - old black girl selling water ; and " BBQ Becky " in California who called the police on a group of black people having a barbecue at a park .
That significance is n't lost on Holland .
He hopes that the way he handled the situation may lead to positive change and help others placed in similar situations remember to always keep their cool . "
It 's extremely frustrating .
I 'm from the inner city ; I 'm from a place where we did n't have a pool in the neighborhood .
Now that I 'm at an age and a place where I can afford to attain that , I still have to deal with being profiled , " he said . "
I feel like more and more people in 2018 are comfortable telling young African - Americans what they should and should not be doing . "
More : Police called on 11-year - old African - American newspaper carrier in Ohio More : Woman fired after calling the police on a black man for wearing socks in community pool More:'ID Adam ' : Man who questioned black woman 's right to use pool loses job Holland also feels that the officer was trying to provoke him into a more extreme response by taking the key from him . "
As a man , I feel like when someone snatches something out of your hand , it natural to want to react , " he said . "
But I felt like if I moved , anything she felt that was an aggressive or threatening ... she could have used force on me .
And that would have been the worst - case scenario . " (
The property manager ) and the police officer both had the authority in the situation , but they did n't use it correctly .
That is what we complain about . "
Despite the altercation , Holland said he does n't plan on leaving River Crossing anytime soon .
He said Wednesday morning that he had a positive meeting with Stokely and is waiting to see how the investigation unfolds . "
Mr. Stokely , he understood my point of view . ...
He told me there was no reason I had to be removed from the pool . "

INDIANAPOLIS - The first time Tim Elliott saw Winx , the pit bull was whimpering in the corner of a post office , shot in the face .
Now , several months - and surgeries - later , the dog has been officially adopted by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer and his wife .
Elliott encountered Winx on May 9 bleeding from a gunshot wound and doused in what he later discovered to be bleach . "
When I actually came in there , he wagged his tail , got up and came to me , and then just kind of collapsed by my legs , " he said .
Indianapolis Animal Care and Control retrieved him , but Elliott did n't stop thinking about the dog .
He and his wife , Tiffany , visited him the next day and decided to foster Winx at home as he recovered .
More : Woman finds dog without a tongue .
More : Mom fed daughter bleach chemical to ' help her autism , police say " We knew we were going to adopt him as soon as we brought him home , " he said , " because he made this his house . ...
He pretty much made the decision before we did . "
Nursing Winx back to health was no easy task .
He needed to be hand - fed expensive canned food , administered eye drops and medication and required three surgeries , including one to remove his left eye .
Money raised via GoFundMe has offset the cost of Winx 's food , other supplies and ongoing medical care .
Anything left over will likely be used to buy toys and other supplies for Indianapolis Animal Care Services , Elliott said .
Elliott said he has seen Winx come out of his shell over the past three months .
He has become a curious and playful but protective pet , making what could be considered a gruff first impression with visitors .
But his growls quickly become begs for affection because all Winx wants is to " be loved on . " "
He follows us around like our shadow , " Elliott said .
Winx sleeps with a brown bear chew toy ( his " Wubba " ) and plays with his furry siblings : a German shepherd named Porter , another pit bull named Gauge , and cats Remington and Ryder - all rescues . "
If we had a bigger house and more land , we probably would have , probably , a couple dozen dogs and ( an ) ungodly amount of cats if it was up to my wife , " Elliott joked .
Winx was n't the first dog Elliott has come across on the job , nor will he be the last .
On a typical day , Elliott and his beat partners receive at least two calls about stray dogs . "
I keep dog leashes , treats in the trunk of the car , " he said . "
Then I 'll either drive them to animal control because they 're so busy , or they 'll just ride with me all shift until they can come pick them up . "
He said it 's " heart - wrenching " to respond to a call of a severely injured animal . "
Why would anybody do this to an animal ? "
he said . "
Even if it is ' aggressive ' or ' mean , ' as everybody calls in and says , they do still have a soft spot .
Like people , you 've just got to find what they like and build from there . "
Although it 's been a journey , Elliott said he and Tiffany are excited to officially add Winx to their brood . "
He 's very thankful that he 's here , " he said . "
You can tell . "

At the close , shares were down 5.8 % on the year , compared with a 5.3 % rise in the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % and a 1.9 % gain on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % .
The best - performing segment of IBMs business against expectations was , again , the legacy mainframes business , an older business that IBM has tried to pivot away from but is currently finding gains amid a refresh .
Systems revenue -- which includes operating - systems software and the companys mainframe business , including IBMs z14 line of servers -- jumped 23 % to $ 2.18 billion while analysts were expecting $ 1.86 billion .
Earlier this year : IBM broke a long losing streak thanks to some of its oldest technology " With regard to mainframe , I am not going to apologize , " IBM Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said in a conference call Wednesday afternoon . "
This is the most enduring platform that you ve seen out there .
And we continue to capitalize on gaining new emerging workloads under that platform . "
While a booming systems business is a positive for IBM , that trend is nt sustainable and probably wo nt survive into 2019 , Andrew Bartels , principal analyst at Forrester Research , told MarketWatch .
Bartels said tax breaks encouraged businesses to invest in hardware infrastructure , and large businesses that IBM caters to , like banks and financial services companies , have been driving IBMs mainframe gains that were instrumental in breaking a long streak of revenue declines three quarters ago . "
The bad news is when you look across each of the segments , " Bartels said . "
This is not encouraging for a company focusing on software and services . "
Here 's what most investors get wrong about disruption While revenue from IBMs " Strategic Imperatives " group has risen 12 % to $ 39 billion over the last 12 months , representing 48 % of revenue , Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi pointed out that a lot of SI growth comes from legacy equipment , with about 40 % of mainframe revenue and about 60 % of Unix hardware revenue classified as SI revenue . "
Almost all growth was currency or hardware , " Forresters Bartels said . "
That s discouraging . "
Technology services and cloud - platform revenue , which includes IBM Cloud , was flat at $ 8.62 billion from the year - ago period , while analysts were forecasting an average of $ 8.62 billion .
IBM said cognitive - solutions revenue , which includes Watson AI , declined 1 % to $ 4.58 billion while analysts expected $ 4.76 billion .
Global business services revenue rose 2 % to $ 4.19 billion , with analysts estimating $ 4.17 billion , and Global business services includes consulting for modernizing business design and enterprise and cloud applications , while Security revenue , which runs across business segments , surged 79 percent from a year ago to $ 1 billion , IBM said .

Overall , the company reported second - quarter net income of $ 2.4 billion , or $ 2.61 a share , compared with $ 2.33 billion , or $ 2.48 a share , in the year - ago period .
Adjusted earnings were $ 3.08 a share .
Revenue rose to $ 20 billion from $ 19.3 billion in the year - ago period .
Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated $ 3.04 a share on revenue of $ 19.85 billion .
IBM reiterated its full - year adjusted earnings outlook of " at least $ 13.80 " a share .
Analysts , on average , expect $ 13.77 a share , according to FactSet .

Investing might seem easy .
Know some excellent rules , choose wisely among your many options , put everything on " automatic pilot , " and then wait ( and wait some more ) to get the results you desire .
But in real life , investing is tough for human beings who have fears and desires and other emotional reactions . (
Hint : That s all of us . )
This makes it really difficult to " do the right things " with money we ve set aside for the future .
Here are seven of the hardest hurdles that investors must somehow get past .
In every case , there s one fundamental problem that has no solution : We do nt know the future , and we ca nt know the future .
Tough decision No .
1 : Spend money or save it ?
We know we should save money for the future .
But there s no end of other things that demand our money .
When were young , we may be setting up households , raising young kids , paying student loans -- all while we are pretty sure we are nowhere near the peak of our earnings .
When were in our middle years , we may be sending kids to college .
When were close to retirement , perhaps the nest is empty and we can finally take the time to travel and pursue some long - postponed dreams .
Essentially the whole world wants us to spend , and easy credit is dangled before our eyes everywhere we look .
Its never easy .
But the " right thing " is to follow the old rule to " pay yourself first . "
In this case , " yourself " means your future self who is going to want or need to retire .
Tough decision No .
2 : Should you invest in stocks and risk losing the precious money you have set aside instead of spending it on what you want and need ?
Anyone who s even semiliterate about investing in equities knows that some losses are inevitable .
Its even worse for people who believe they are personally so unlucky that whatever they do is very likely to be wrong .
The " right thing to do " is to diversify widely in asset classes that have strong long - term performance records -- and then do your best to ignore the inevitable short - term ups and downs .
When he was becoming one of the first " Microsoft MSFT , -0.15 % millionaires " several decades ago , Bill Gates once told a reporter that he looked at the companys stock price only about once a month .
He had the right idea .
Tough decision No .
3 : Should you sell -- or keep -- and investment that has ' failed you ?
This is a big worry to many people partly because they do nt have any objective nonemotional way to know when an investment has " failed " them .
Lets say that mutual fund ( or heaven forbid , that individual stock ) you bought is suddenly down by 25 % or 30 % .
What should you do ?
Some investors establish an " Ill cut my loss " discipline after a certain percentage drop .
Others might adopt a plan of " Ill buy more " on the theory that the price has become a bargain .
Each of these approaches is logical and rational .
But which is the right thing to do ?
You ca nt know , because you ca nt know the future .
How millennials are disrupting the financial adviser industry Tough decision No .
4 : Should you invest when the market has been going up ?
Rising stock prices mean every dollar buys you a little less than it did previously .
A rising market may be a trend that will continue .
But how will you know when the trend has run its course and is about to reverse direction , when its time to sell ?
The simple answer is : You wo nt know that until its too late to do something about it .
Tough decision No .
5 : Should you invest when the market has been going down ?
Objectively , this is the best time to invest as long as you have faith in the long - term .
Yet falling markets erode that faith .
And there s that " trend " thing again .
If the market keeps falling , you will have even more favorable buying opportunities later -- but you may also have less and less reason for long - term faith .
And every day that you watch your new " bargain " investment fall in value , you ll have more reason to doubt yourself .
Decisions 3 , 4 and 5 can be applied to the question of whether you should sell , too .
The answers are nt any more obvious .
The problem is the same : You do nt know the future , so you ca nt be certain of the results of whatever you do .
These dilemmas concern timing of purchases and sales .
Lots of salespeople and pundits will tell you they know where the market is going in the short or the medium term .
But they do nt , because they ca nt .
That s the bad news about timing .
The good news , however , actually is pretty good indeed .
Good news part 1 : We have reliable data , going back in some cases more than 90 years , indicating that the long - term trend of the stock market is up .
Despite what sometimes seem like insurmountable problems we are facing , I believe that long - term trend will continue .
Good news part 2 : If you re investing for the long term , you can short - circuit all those pesky buy and sell decisions by following one extremely simple formula : The time to buy is when you have the money to do so .
The time to sell is when you need the money .
That wo nt guarantee you the best prices on either end .
But it will relieve you of a great deal of hand - wringing and worry about what to do .
Here are two more tough investment decisions , each of which deserves more space than I can give it here .
Tough decision No .
6 : Should you try to beat the market by hiring smart , hardworking managers who say they have the research , the computer skills , and the brains to beat the market and get better - than - average ?
Or should you settle for " average " market returns by investing in index funds ?
The right answer might surprise you . "
Average " is a really tough sell in our society .
Exceptional brains and tools , combined with lots of hard work , are regarded as the surest path to success .
But when it comes to investing , that bit of conventional wisdom is dead wrong .
The well - documented reality is that far too many investors shoot themselves in the foot trying to beat the market SPX , -1.18 % .
Largely because of their own behavior , the majority of investors wind up with returns that fail to even match the market , let alone beat it .
An index fund will capture the return of the market -- and that will make you an above - average investor .
Beating the market is the wrong objective .
Much better : Seek either the lowest - risk way to meet your needs , or the highest return you can reasonably expect within your risk tolerance .
Tough decision No .
7 : Should you keep up on financial news or ignore it ?
The financial media constantly bombard readers , viewers and listeners with news , information and commentary .
Read : Retirees : Stop paying attention to the markets Much of it is contradictory .
In any given week you can find plenty of commentary that might paint a bright financial future and make you confident .
And in the same week you can find commentators painting a dark picture and urging great caution .
I have known far too many people who got so upset by the financial news that they abandoned their carefully laid plans to try to protect themselves from some imaginary boogeyman .
Often , the best answer is simple : Turn off the TV .
When you ca nt control the future and you ca nt even know it , there are better uses for your time and energy .

Pandora , Roku and Spotify have surged 71 percent , 49 percent and 19 percent , respectively , in the last three months .
Spotify is the youngest public company of the bunch , debuting in a direct listing in April .
These stocks have handily benefited from an economy flooded with subscription models , said Boris Schlossberg , managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management .
The growing popularity of subscription services , particularly across media , has been key to these names success . "
They are essentially trading on the fact that they are growing their subscriptions .
It really does nt matter how profitable they are ; it almost does nt even matter how much revenue they have .
Its the subscription growth that really attracts them , because then it makes them a candidate for M&A for , probably , old media , " he said Thursday on CNBCs " Trading Nation . " "
Until and unless their subscription growth rate slows down , I think its very dangerous to short them at this point .
That s the dynamic that s really driving them , and that s the dynamic that could push them even higher as we go from this point , " he added .
The charts of Spotify and Roku may be difficult to technically analyze given their relatively short lives as public companies , said Matt Maley , equity strategist at Miller Tabak , but shares of Pandora appear to have more room to run .
Maley noted the stocks overbought condition , but pointed out its come a long way from its 63 percent decline in 2017 alone . "
Although its overbought on a near - term basis and could pull back a little bit here , there are a lot of reasons to think this chart could have some more upside , at least after it takes a bit of a breather , " he said Thursday on " Trading Nation , " pointing specifically to a so - called island reversal , a traditionally bullish technical signal .
Investors flee from Einhorn 's Greenlight Capital : WSJ The " Squawk Box " news team discuss the front - page story from the Wall Street Journal on David Einhorn 's hedge fund , Greenlight Capital .
Investors should prepare for a near 1 percentage point increase on the U.S. 10-year sovereign bond yield before the end of 2018 , according to one investment manager , who cited robust wage growth and tightening monetary policy .
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note is a benchmark government bond that helps set prices for debt instruments all over the world , including U.S. mortgages -- making it a critical asset to track for those seeking to invest .
This means that when the yield moves higher consumers are likely to have less money available to spend as mortgage repayments rise .
It also means that firms will face higher costs on their debts and thus offer fewer returns for equity investors or curb expansion .
According to one investment manager there could be a large increase in U.S. interest rates before year - end , provided a trade war does not escalate . "
I think we are above 3.5 percent by year - end ... And if you push me I think 3.75 percent , " Patrick Armstrong , chief investment officer at Plurimi Investment Managers , told CNBCs " Squawk Box Europe " Friday .
On Friday morning , the yield on the 10-year Treasury note stood at 2.8327 percent .

Irish eyes were smiling on Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Wednesday as the royal couple launched a day of colorful engagements in Dublin during their first foreign trip together since their May wedding .
And already Meghan has shown off two new outfits .
First , she wore a gray / taupe Roland Mouret midi dress with a dramatic ruffle detail to meet Irish President Michael Higgins and his wife Sabina Coyne , and their two furry Bernese Mountain dogs , who seemed ecstatic to meet the duchess .
Meghan wore black suede pumps and carried a large Fendi bag .
Her hair was pulled back in a low offside bun .
Then she quickly changed into a black Givenchy cropped double - breasted blazer and ankle - length pants , for a visit to Croke Park , headquarters of Ireland 's Gaelic sports organization .
Somehow , she managed to navigate the pitch in her towering black heels , and she carried a new bag , a Givenchy clutch .
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived in Dublin Tuesday evening , taking on their first international role as a royal couple representing his grandmother , Queen Elizabeth II , and her government .
They are spending most of Wednesday in Dublin , getting to know Ireland 's capital and its people and immersing themselves in what Kensington Palace calls organizations " central to Irish life . "
They are also hoping to further reinforce the relationship between Britain and Ireland , the two next - door islands that have emerged from centuries of fraught history to a new era reconciliation , led in no small part by the queen herself .
The royal couple 's first engagement was at Aras an Uachtarain , the presidential residence , to meet with Higgins and Coyne and their huge dogs .
Then they went to Croke Park , home of the Gaelic Athletic Association , Ireland 's largest sporting organization .
They checked out Croke Park 's museum , which displays artifacts from the 1920 Bloody Sunday clash there that killed 32 , Irish and British , during the Irish War of Independence from Britain .
In a lighter moment , Harry was asked if " football was coming home " - a reference to England 's chances of winning the soccer World Cup later Wednesday - and the prince triggered laughter when he answered with a grin : " Most definitely . " (
Alas for him , Croatia beat England in the semi - final and will face France for the World Cup on Sunday . )
The royal duo also displayed some kid - friendly moves : When 3-year - old Walter Kieran reached out to touch Meghan 's hair and face , she smiled and held his hand .
And Harry let another toddler in arms stroke his famous red beard .
On the field , they got to meet athletes and watch traditional Gaelic sports , such as hurling , camogie and rounders .
Both are interested in deploying sports for social good as one of their philanthropic goals .
The most anticipated engagement , as in any royal tour , was their walkabout in Trinity College 's Parliament Square , where they were mobbed by hundreds of screaming and shouting well - wishers waving phones and presenting them with flowers .
They also got to see the Brian Boru Harp , the oldest in Ireland , and the famous Book of Kells in Trinity 's historic Old Library .
Later , they paid respects at the moving memorial to the Irish Famine of the mid-19th century , and explored the Irish Emigration Museum .
An estimated one million people died from starvation or from typhus and other famine - related diseases during the famine and the estimated number of Irish who emigrated during four years of the famine may have reached two million .
The royal couple checked out Dublin 's " Digital Docklands " where start - up tech firms share working spaces , and met female tech entrepreneurs at a birthday celebration for CoderDojo , a global network of free computer programming clubs for young people .
Meghan , 36 , is becoming a royal pro at having fun while greeting fans at rope lines , having participated in multiple walkabouts since her engagement to Harry was announced in November 2017 .
Harry , 33 , is a natural at this and a popular member of the royal family in part because he has always seemed authentically pleased to shake hands , chat with well - wishers and smile for their cameras .
Harry and Meghan arrived in Dublin Tuesday evening , following a day of ceremonies in London celebrating the centenary of the Royal Air Force .
They headed first to a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar , then to a summer garden party at Glencairn House , the residence of the British ambassador to Ireland .
By the time of the party , Meghan was on her third outfit of the day and it was a stunner : A sleek , sleeveless little black dress by Emilia Wickstead , with an A - line silhouette , square neckline , midi length and a belt .

It did nt take long for Kylie Jenner to become the latest target of the internet outrage machine this week after Forbes bestowed the 20-year - old with the title of one of Americas richest self - made women .
Almost immediately , a rash of headlines appeared about the social media backlash to Jenners appearance on the list .
Dictonary.com even weighed in , tweeting out the definition of self - made as " having succeeded in life unaided . "
You ca nt deny that Kylie , the youngest member of the famed for being famous Jenner - Kardashian clan , had an enviable leg - up in starting her eponymous cosmetics business , which Forbes estimates is now worth $ 900 million .
But the digs at her success provide a window into how differently we view women entrepreneurs from their male counterparts . "
There are several gendered reasons why Kylies startup success is less likely to be taken seriously than if she were , say , ' Kyle Jenner , " Dana Kanze , a doctoral fellow at Columbia Business School , told MarketWatch in an email .
A copious body of evidence backs up that assertion .
Kanzes own research found that venture capitalists tend to ask different questions of female and male entrepreneurs when evaluating whether they ll fund their businesses .
Female founders are more likely to receive questions about their companys potential pitfalls , while men tend to get questions about their companys potential gains . "
Venture capitalists tend to ask different questions of female and male entrepreneurs when evaluating whether they ll fund their businesses . "
Other research shows that venture capitalists actually use different words to describe male and female founders .
Men are more likely to be described as " assertive , innovative , competent , experienced , knowledgeable , and having established networks , " according to a study by researchers affiliated with the Lulea University of Technology in Sweden .
And when venture capitalists meet young founders , the way they evaluate their youth tends to also be gendered , the researchers found .
Young men are viewed as promising , young women are viewed as inexperienced . "
Broadly , our research suggests that stereotyping through language underpins the image of a man as a true entrepreneur while undermining the image of a woman as the same , " the researchers wrote in the Harvard Business Review .
Put another way : " Kylie defies the stereotype of what the public consciousness perceives as a deservingly successful startup CEO -- one who is male , tech savvy , and has attended Stanford , " Kanze wrote . "
The origin stories of female - focused startups are littered with tales of men struggling to understand the value of their product or service . "
Another impediment to the public taking Kylies success seriously : Her business caters to women .
The origin stories of female - focused startups are littered with tales of men struggling to understand the value of their product or service .
When the founder of Naya Health Inc. , Janica Alvarez , went searching for funders for her breast pump - focused start up , potential investors often told her that they would need to talk to their sister or wife to help them understand the product , Alvarez told Bloomberg last year .
Jennifer Hyman , the co - founder of Rent the Runway , told HuffPost last year that she still spends a significant amount of time explaining to potential male investors why women searching for wardrobe variety may want to rent clothes .
That s despite being one of the most recognizable fashion startups in the country .
Kylies trick was recognizing that , like herself , other women might want a product that made it easier to create a fuller lip -- especially if she popularized the look .
Even though Kylies lip kits wound up forming the basis of a nearly $ 1 billion company , they still appear to be taken less seriously than other products or " disruptions " with similar levels of success . (
Case in point : Americas recent scooter obsession . )
Kylie Jenner on the Forbes cover Forbes The Forbes cover story barely mentions the features of the product itself .
Instead , were left to believe the only reason young women are buying Kylie lip kits is because of their proximity to fame , not because Kylie provided the women with a product they were actually seeking .
Of course , Kylies huge platform is a major part of what made her business successful .
Her Instagram FB , -4.27 % account has 111 million followers .
Unfortunately , given the skepticism women business owners face , particularly those who sell female - focused products , the sad truth is that having reality television fame , a steady income -- Kylie reportedly funded her first 15,000 lip kits with money she earned from modeling jobs -- and a social network may be one of the few paths for success available right now to female entrepreneurs .
Female founders received just 2 % of venture capital dollars last year . "
Though few aspiring entrepreneurs have access to her level of resources , its not as if all of the worlds most successful men have a Horatio Alger - esque origin story . "
And though few aspiring entrepreneurs have access to her level of resources , its not as if all of the worlds most successful men have a Horatio Alger - esque origin story .
As Anne Vandermay noted in a recent column for Bloomberg , Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg created an instant messaging platform for his dads dental practice at the age of 12 and Twitters TWTR , -2.55 % co - founder Jack Dorsey had a programming internship at 15 . "
Todays prototypical founding story involves an upper - middle - class childhood , early access to a computer and an elite education , " Vandermay writes .
Those assets are no match for a reality show and a famous family , but its hard to describe someone who achieves success with those advantages as self - made .
And yet , no one appears to quibble with Forbes bestowing Zuckerberg with the title of youngest self - made billionaire ( a distinction he may soon surrender to Jenner ) .
Much tea has been spilled about whether the Kardashian - Jenner clan are savvy business women , but if we are going to divide the worlds richest people -- most of whom ended up in that position with the help of some combination of privileges -- into people who used that privilege to fuel their success and those who simply inherited millions from their families , its pretty clear which camp Kylie and her sisters fall into .
Its the same camp as many of the heads of other highly valued startups -- with one clear difference .
Kylie is " selling high volumes of actual product rather than smoke - and - mirrors promises , " Kanze wrote .
It has been almost two months since Prince Harry and Meghan Markle 's wedding .
Since then , the new duchess has settled into her role as an international fashion icon .
This week , she has dazzled with a variety of looks , sometimes multiple outfit changes in one day , beginning with Prince Louis 's christening Monday .
That was followed by a celebration Tuesday honoring the Royal Air Force and a trip with Harry to Ireland .
Here 's a breakdown of six of her most recent looks : The Duchess showed off her first of two looks Wednesday in Ireland for her and Prince Harry 's first official foreign trip as a couple .
She donned a taupe custom Roland Mouret dress with black suede pumps from English designer Paul Andrew and carried a black Fendi Peekaboo bag .
She paired what 's becoming her signature boatneck silhouette with Birks Snowflake Snowstorm Earrings .
Later that day , the couple made a few stops to the Croke Park 's museum , Trinity College and the Irish Emigration Museum .
Meghan changed her getup , this time sporting a custom cropped black Givenchy double - breasted blazer with ankle - length pants and black Sarah Flint Perfect Pumps along with a Givenchy black buckle belt and frame bag .
After arriving in Ireland Tuesday , the couple attended a garden party at the British ambassador 's residence , where Meghan wore a sleeveless black dress from Emilia Wickstead with a square neckline and belt .
She finished the outfit with a pair of sparkling citrine and diamond drop earrings from Birks , a black Givenchy clutch and a pair of black pumps with bows on the heels from Aquazzura , an Italian shoe company known for modern flare .
Earlier that day , she channeled the Irish while meeting with Prime Minister Leo Varadkar , sporting a matching dark green top and skirt set from Givenchy and carrying a tan Strathberry bag : another brand Meghan is a big fan of .
She chose another pair of suede heels from Paul Andrew , this time in taupe .
Harry played along with the Irish theme , wearing an olive - green tie .
Earlier Tuesday , she wore a fit - and - flared dark navy dress from Dior with - what else ? -
a boatneck neckline and a custom Stephen Jones swirl fascinator .
She also paired it with nude suede heels , another Meghan staple , and navy clutch , both custom - made by Christian Dior .
Her earrings ( which she wore on her wedding ! )
were an intricate diamond and white gold design from Cartier .
The duchess wore a custom olive - green dress from Ralph Lauren for the christening of Prince Louis on Monday at the Chapel Royal in St. James 's Palace in London .
She added another custom Stephen Jones fascinator with a green clutch and green suede gloves , along with the same wedding Cartier earrings .
Her heels were olive suede pumps from Manolo Blahnik .

It was almost a perfect getaway , but a former Apple employee was captured at the airport just before boarding a flight to China , after apparently stealing some of the tech giant 's secret plans for self - driving cars .
The ex - employee , Xiaolang Zhang , had been a person of interest , already interviewed several times by Apple , and also by the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
When he booked a last - minute flight to China on July 7 , Zhang was arrested at the San Jose International Airport by FBI agents .
He has been charged with theft of trade secrets , according to a criminal complaint filed Monday in federal court in San Jose .
The intrigue began months ago .
Hired in December 2015 to work on Apple 's project to develop hardware and software for self - driving or autonomous vehicles , Zhang took paternity leave during April and traveled with his family to China , according to the complaint .
More : Apple has permits to test 55 self - driving cars that few outside Apple have ever seen More : Uber to shut down self - driving car operation in Arizona after fatality More : Tesla , Uber crashes spotlight automatic emergency braking .
Here 's what it wo n't do .
Upon his return on April 30 , Zhang told his immediate superior he was resigning to move back to China to be closer to his mother , who was in poor health .
Zhang also said he planned to work for XMotors , a Chinese autonomous and electric vehicle startup , which has offices in Silicon Valley .
That set off some alarm bells at Apple , which asked Zhang to turn in two iPhones and a MacBook and then the security team began reviewing his network activity , the filing says .
Apple 's investigation found that Zhang on April 28 and 29 had downloaded confidential technical documents about self driving car prototypes , which were subsequently downloaded onto his wife 's laptop , authorities say .
Surveillance footage and badge swipe records also found that Zhang had entered Apple 's autonomous vehicle labs on April 28 and left with a keyboard , some cables and a large box , the complaint charges .
This activity took place at a time when he was on paternity leave , which is against company policy .
During another interview at Apple on May 2 , Zhang admitted to seeking a job with XMotors while on staff at Apple .
Zhang said he had downloaded the data to study it on his own and admitted to being shown a proprietary chip by Apple colleagues during his April 28 visit .
After the interview , Zhang retrieved and brought to Apple a Linux server and circuit boards he had taken from the lab , and his wifes laptop , which he denied forwarding any data from .
Apple informed the FBI about the data taken , which included a 25-page document containing electrical schematics for a circuit board used in Apples proprietary self - driving project .
During an interview with the FBI on June 27 , Zhang admitted to everything he had told Apple .
When the agency learned that Zhang planned to fly to Beijing , with a final destination of Hangzhou , China on Hainan Airlines , the FBI apprehended him at the airport as he passed through a security checkpoint , the complaint says .
In a statement to USA TODAY , Apple said the company " takes confidentiality and the protection of our intellectual property very seriously .
Were working with authorities on this matter and will do everything possible to make sure this individual and any other individuals involved are held accountable for their actions . "
XMotors said it has not gotten any trade secrets Zhang may have taken from Apple and follows the laws of both countries , taking the protection of intellectual property rights seriously , company spokeswoman Isabel Jiang told Bloomberg .

Its a tradition unlike any other : NBA players embarrassing the young campers who pay good money to attend their events .
The summer of 2018 will be no exception , though Boston Celtics stars Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum provided a unique twist to the pastime by teaming up to dominate teenagers together .
The video you see below comes from Irving and Tatums combined basketball camp , sponsored by Citibank .
The two young stars took on a pair of the Hanover , Mass. camps attendees , eventually embarrassing both with a series of playground moves and , eventually , an easy Tatum dunk .
None of those things are surprising , but they are entertaining , provided that you are nt one of the poor kids trying to shut down Uncle Drew or one of the most versatile breakthrough rookies in some time .
It wo nt be the last time we see an NBA star embarrass some young whippersnapper this summer , but it might be the only time we see a pair of them do it together .
Its worth celebrating the novelty amidst all of Irvings ball - handling genius and Tatums octopus arms and quick hips .
Its bearish for gold that market timers have been remarkably upbeat in the face of golds dismal performance this year .
In fact , despite gold bullion US : GCQ8 falling $ 140 an ounce since its January high , the average gold timer I track has not turned outright bearish .
From a contrarian perspective that means that a tradable gold bottom is not yet upon us .
Consider the average recommended gold - market exposure level among monitored gold timers , as measured by the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Index ( or HGNSI ) .
It currently stands at 0 % , indicating that the typical timer is out of the gold market but not outright short .
The current index level is right in the middle of its historical range , which extends from minus 56.7 % to plus 89.7 % .
The question that contrarians are asking : Why , if gold has performed so poorly , are gold timers on balance no worse than neutral ?
As I mentioned in a column in late June , tradable gold bottoms typically are accompanied by HGNSI readings at least as low as minus 30 % .
Because the HGNSI at that time had not gotten any lower than minus 13 % , I concluded that " golds losing strike may get even worse . "
Ethereum co - founder : Blockchain - based wallet could end need for banks The sentiment picture is even less encouraging today .
With gold down another $ 15 since that late - June column , we d otherwise expect the average recommended gold exposure level to be even lower than minus 13 % .
That s because the normal pattern is for market timers to become more- and less bullish along with the markets rallies and declines .
That the average market timer did not behave in this way suggests there is a strong undercurrent of stubbornly held bullishness in the gold market .
That s not the sentiment foundation on which strong rallies typically are built .
To be sure , sentiment is not the only factor impacting the markets .
And even when contrarian analysis forecast is accurate , it applies primarily to the shorter term rather than the longer term .
So golds discouraging sentiment picture does not by any means translate into a guarantee that golds near - term direction is down -- or that gold a year from now could nt be higher .
Still , its worth noting the failure of other widely cited factors to account for golds recent short - term weakness .
Take inflation , since gold is widely considered to be an inflation hedge .
In contrast to the Consumer Price Indexs 2.1 % increase in 2017 , its rate of increase over the last 12 months is 2.9 % .
Other things equal , therefore , one would have thought that gold would have increased this year -- not fallen significantly .
Or take geopolitical risks , since gold is widely thought to be a hedge against geopolitical uncertainty .
At least according to an index of such uncertainty that has been constructed by two economists at the Federal Reserve , however , geopolitical risk today is slightly higher than it was last year .
So , to the extent gold hedges such uncertainty , you d expect gold to be higher today than earlier this year .
The bottom line : Contrarians wo nt trigger a buy signal until the gold timers on balance become much more discouraged .

Its fair to wonder how much more outperformance we can expect from small - cap stocks , considering how well they have been performing in 2018 .
But there are always areas of innovation and demand that can make you money .
Jamie Cuellar , the manager of the Buffalo Small - Cap Fund , discussed two trends and three companies poised to take advantage of them .
First , heres a comparison of the 2018 performance of the Russell 2000 Index RUT , -2.34 % , the S&P Small - Cap 600 SML , -1.53 % and the large - cap S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % : FactSet Both small - cap indexes have more than doubled the performance of the S&P 500 this year .
So what does this mean ?
It certainly means an endless array of sensational headlines , some of which warn that the fast ride for small - cap stocks can not last , in part , because domestic small - cap companies are expected to see larger benefits this year from the federal tax cut and rising dollar than larger companies .
But for long - term investors it may not be such a surprise to see small - caps outperforming .
Heres the same chart , but for 10 years : FactSet That s an impressive track record , showing how important it is to have exposure to small - cap stocks , as well as the large - caps that dominate the headlines .
Read : You can make more money on small - cap stocks by playing this overlooked index Two trends Kornitzer Capital Management of Mission , Kansas , manages about $ 7 billion in client assets and is the subadviser for Buffalo Funds .
Cuellar has managed the Buffalo Small - Cap Fund BUFSX , -2.92 % since January 2015 .
Cuellars style is to identify companies with potential for " good revenue growth , with good pricing power and margins " for investments of three to five years .
In an interview on July 13 , he said the funds typical annual turnover of about 40 % is low compared with a typical 100 % turnover for actively managed small - cap funds .
Jamie Cuellar , manager of the Buffalo Small Cap Fund .
Kornitzer Capital Management The two trends he focused on during the interview were increasing demand for SaaS computing ( software as a service ) and communications bandwidth .
The SaaS trend has been important for large - cap companies , including Microsoft MSFT , -0.15 % , with its cloud services and the migration of Microsoft Office to a subscription model .
Other prime examples in the large - cap world include Salesforce.com CRM , -11.74 % and Workday WDAY , -4.88 % .
The long - term SaaS trend has lowered risk for many software companies because under the old licensing model , " if you missed a sale , it had a devastating effect on the business model , " Cuellar said .
With this years strong performance , he said he had trimmed many positions in software companies , but here are two stocks of SaaS companies he believes are still trading at attractive valuations : Pros Holdings Pros Holdings PRO , -6.33 % makes price - optimization software and has " more recently made the transition " from the old licensing model to SaaS , according to Cuellar .
The transition to a subscription model can be a rocky one , as investors may not appreciate the ( hopefully temporary ) disruption to sales figures in companies quarterly earnings reports .
But for Pros Holdings , the transition is nearly complete and " they are expanding the market , " as they bring in new customers who were unable to afford the old licenses , Cuellar said . "
Price optimization is getting a lot more important , " especially in the retail and travel industries , he added . "
This group is typically valued on revenue .
This one we have at about six times forward revenue , against eight or nine times for the group , " Cuellar said .
Twilio Twilio TWLO , -9.30 % actually straddles both trends -- providing application programming interfaces ( API ) that allow companies to communicate with customers through their own systems .
Twilio is typically paid based on usage , with fees charged per text or minute of voice communication . "
They are the largest network out there for this , " Cuellar said .
One major stumbling block for the company was the loss of Uber as a customer , because Uber was able to take its API development in - house .
But Cuellar expects sales growth to improve this year and also believes estimates for Twilio are too low . "
Twilio also has new products coming , including a customizable call center called Flex and another that helps customers connect to the internet of things , " which refers to the trend for nearly any appliance or device in the home to be connected to the internet , he said . "
Twilio is trading at seven times my revenue estimate for 2019 , while [ rapidly growing SaaS companies ] trade upwards of 10 times , " he added When discussing the demand for increased communications bandwidth , Cuellar focused on the rollout of 5 G service , which will begin with large carriers connecting fiber - optic cable to cell towers for high - speed wireless service to homes and business in areas that do nt currently have cable or high - speed fiber - optic services available .
MasTec A company that is taking advantage of the trend toward outsourcing construction for communications , pipeline and power transmission construction is MasTec MTZ , -2.15 % . "
All parts of the company are doing well , " Cuellar said .
AT&T T , -2.63 % and Comcast are among MasTecs largest customers . "
Valuation on this one is pretty reasonable .
It generally trades 18 to 19 times forward earnings , but is currently trading around 13 times , " he said .
Fund performance and holdings Morningstar rates the Buffalo Small - Cap Fund three stars out of five .
The fund has one share class with total annual expenses of 1.02 % , which Morningstar considers " below average " for its small growth category .
The funds performance ( after expenses ) has been much better than its Morningstar category , its benchmark , the Russell 2000 Index and the S&P 600 Small - Cap Index this year and in 2017 .
It has beaten its category and the Russell 2000 for most longer periods but has trailed the S&P 600 Small - Cap Index for all of the longer periods .

Its no secret head coach Jim Harbaugh likes his teams to run the football .
From his time at Stanford , Harbaugh has been known for his gap - based run schemes .
That has been the case at Michigan , too , for the most part .
One difference ?
Harbaugh has nt had a lead back like former Stanford running back Toby Gerhart .
The Wolverines have yet to have a 1,000-yard rusher under Harbaugh , who has been more than happy to spread carries around .
Last season , Karan Higdon and Chris Evans combined for 299 carries for 1,679 yards and 17 touchdowns .
Both return this year -- Higdon is a senior and Evans a junior .

Jan. 6 panel recommends contempt for Jeffrey Clark The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol advanced a measure to hold Jeffrey Clark in criminal contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena .
However , the former Justice Department official may have one last chance to avoid potential prosecution .
CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge joins CBSN 's Lana Zak with the details of the vote .
Jeff Metcalfe - inactive The Republic | azcentral.com Darryl Rogers , who died Wednesday at age 83 , was one of Arizona States most successful football coaches in the post - Frank Kush era .
Rogers had four winning teams in five seasons ( 1980 - 84 ) at ASU and an overall record of 37 - 18 - 1 .
His 1981 and 82 teams were a combined 19 - 4 with each just missing out on becoming ASUs first Rose Bowl qualifier .
The 1982 team beat Oklahoma 32 - 21 in the Fiesta Bowl and finished No .
6 in the final Associated Press rankings . "
People forget what a really good staff he put together , " said Jeff Van Raaphorst , ASU starting quarterback from 1984 - 86 . "
He let his coaches coach and did nt micro manage .
He was almost more of a pro coach than a college coach , very similar to what coach ( Herm ) Edwards is trying to do - get the right people , turn them loose and develop them . "
Rogers staff included elite recruiters Willie Shaw and Al Luginbill and Mike Martz , who went on to become an NFL head coach .
Luginbill now is back with ASU as director of player personnel . "
I think he had a way with people , " Luginbill said . "
He delegated responsibility and expected you to get it done .
He was n't one of those that demanded you be there until midnight .
It was get the work done , get it done right and away we go . "
I always felt when he left there , there was not enough credit given to him in relationship to the amount of talent that had been accumulated during his time .
He was somebody never mentioned in that realm , it was always before him or after him .
He did a lot to create a really solid Arizona State football program during the ' 80s . "
ASU was one of the nation 's top offensive teams in 1981 with quarterback Mike Pagel and running back Gerald Riggs then won largely on defense in ' 82 . "
Those young men ( in 1982 ) on that defensive group really rose to the occasion , " Luginbill said . "
We did it a different way in those two years and still won . "
Rogers left ASU when he was not given a multi - year contract to become Detroit Lions head coach .
He was Michigan State head coach ( 1976 - 79 ) before coming to ASU .
John Cooper replaced Rogers at ASU and was given a multi - year contract by the Arizona Board of Regents .
Cooper coached the Sun Devils to the Pac-10 title in 1986 and a Rose Bowl win over Michigan when many of his core players were Rogers recruits . "
If ASU had given him what they gave John Cooper , we would have been in the Rose Bowl two more times , " Van Raaphorst said . "
The recruiting class we had coming in before he left for Detroit would have been by far our best .
So many that were committed to us flipped to USC and everywhere else ( after Rogers left ) . "
Rogers was inducted into the ASU Athletic Hall of Fame in 2012 .
All - American players during the Rogers coaching era included safety Mike Richardson , linebacker Vernon Maxwell , safety David Fulcher and kicker Luis Zendejas .
More : Supplemental draft sends two corners to NFC East More:10 college football coaches on the hot seat Rogers died in Fresno , Calif. , where he played in college at Fresno State and later coached ( 1966 - 72 as head coach ) .
He coached at San Jose State ( 1973 - 75 ) before Michigan State and ASU .
After the Detroit Lions ( 1985 - 88 ) , he coached one season in the Canadian Football League then was athletic director at Southern Connecticut before retiring .
Rogers overall college coaching record was 129 - 84 - 7 and his NFL record was 18 - 40 .
He has been a nominee for the College Football Hall of Fame . "
He was supportive , demanded a lot and was just a good person , " Van Raaphorst said . "
He was funny and did a good job staying unflappable ( on the sideline ) .
You never saw any stress in him . "
During a 1984 game against Florida State , Van Raaphorst passed for a then - school record 532 yards in a 52 - 44 loss . "
I was lighting them up like a pinball , and were still down , " Van Raaphorst said . "
He just said we need another one .
You never saw any division , with him it was all about team . "
Rogers hired Don Bocchi on his staff just days before resigning to join the Lions .
Bocchi still is at ASU , now as senior associate athletic director . "
I 'm forever grateful for him hiring me , " Bocchi said . "
I coached against his 1982 team , and it was one of the finest defensive teams I 've ever seen .
They had an air about them that was pretty special . "
Darryl was an incredible recruiter and a gentle man .
He did n't ruffle easily .
He was good for young people and good for the game . "
Rogers is survived by his wife , Marsha , and daughters Stacy and Jamie .
ASU is hosting Michigan State in football on Sept. 8 when both schools can pay tribute to their late head coach .
Jeremy Hunt will replace Boris Johnson as the U.K. foreign secretary following Johnson 's resignation , Downing Street said in a statement Monday .
Johnson resigned earlier in the day in protest against the government 's decision to maintain close ties to the European Union . "
The Queen has been pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs , " British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement .
May tweet Hunt , a champion of a so - called " soft " Brexit , had previously served as health secretary .
His ascension to the post follows a shake up in May 's government caused by the back - to - back resignations of Johnson and Brexit minister David Davis .
In a 2016 article in The Telegraph , Hunt wrote that Britain needed to " calm markets and many worried investors and businesses , both locally and internationally , by making it clear that it is an explicit national objective to remain in the single market even as we leave the institutions of the EU . "
May left open the possibility on Monday that the U.K. and the E.U. would not reach a deal on the terms of a Brexit negotiation before the crucial 2019 deadline .
The pound pared back early gains against the dollar on Monday after Johnson 's announcement .
It remained negative on the day Monday afternoon eastern time .
Jessie Balmert Cincinnati Enquirer CINCINNATI -- Shortly after they were filed , charges were dismissed against porn actress Stormy Daniels , known for suing President Donald Trump , who was arrested at a Columbus , Ohio strip club .
Daniels was arrested Thursday morning after she was accused of squeezing patrons ' and undercover police officers ' faces between her bare breasts at Sirens Gentlemen 's Club in Columbus .
Daniels , whose real name is Stephanie Clifford , was scheduled to perform there Wednesday and Thursday .
Daniels was charged with a little - used 2007 Ohio law , which prohibits strippers from touching patrons - or vice versa - unless they are a relative .
But charges were dismissed because she was n't a regular performer at that establishment - an odd caveat to the law . "
I ve determined that these crimes were not committed , based on the fact that Ms. Clifford has not made regular appearances at this establishment as required under the law , " Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said .
What led to the charges in the first place ?
Daniels started performing at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday , according to an affidavit filed in Franklin County Municipal Court .
Patrons rushed the stage and started throwing dollar bills at her .
Daniels , who was topless and wearing a G - string , reportedly forced patrons faces into her breasts and smacked patrons with them , according to the police report .
At that point , three undercover officers approached the stage .
Daniels was accused of grabbing a female detectives head and forcing the officers face between her breasts .
Daniels reportedly did the same with a male detective as well , the report states .
Then , Daniels was accused of fondling the third officers buttocks and breasts .
Daniels smacked that female officers face with her breasts , according to the affidavit .
A fourth officer , who was not touched , called for assistance to arrest Daniels and two others : Miranda Panda , of Marion , and Brittany Walters , of Pickerington .
Walters , 20 , is accused of rubbing her bare breasts on one undercover officer then fondling that officer ' breasts , according to the Columbus police report .
Panda , 26 , reportedly rubbed another server 's exposed butt in front of undercover officers , according to the report .
Klein , the city attorney , is reviewing their cases to see if they were regular performers or not .
Daniels ' attorney , Michael Avenatti , called the arrest an unnecessary " sting operation " in a tweet .
He called the arrest a setup and said Daniels has performed the act at nearly a hundred strip clubs across the country .
Columbus police said Daniels ' arrest was n't a first . "
Since last fall , Columbus Police were made aware of illegal activity through various adult entertainment clubs throughout the city .
Columbus police have made numerous arrests utilizing this law .
The Division engages in these operations routinely with no effect on other calls for service , " according to a police statement .
Daniels canceled her Thursday night performance in Columbus because of the charges . "
As a result of what happened last night , I will unfortunately be unable to go forward with tonight 's scheduled performance .
I deeply apologize to my fans in Columbus , " Daniels said in a statement released by her attorney .
Daniels has said she had sex with President Donald Trump in 2006 when he was married , which Trump has denied .
She 's suing Trump and his former longtime personal attorney , Michael Cohen , and seeking to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement that she signed days before the 2016 presidential election .

JetBlue Airways will use 60 new Airbus A220 aircraft to replace its existing Embraer 190 planes with more seats aboard planes with larger overhead bins and windows , executives said Wednesday . "
We are absolutely thrilled with the A220 , believing that it balances the needs of all of our stakeholders , " President Joanna Geraghty told investors and reporters during a conference call .
Marty St. George , JetBlues executive vice president for commercial and planning , said A220s are versatile enough with a 3,300 nautical - mile range to use on short and medium - length flights , and - possibly - for transcontinental service .
JetBlue will begin taking delivery of the jets in 2020 .
Because A220s are more efficient , the airframes cost less to fly despite holding up to 40 percent more seats than the E190s they 'll replace , officials said .
Markets ripe for larger A220s include routes like Westchester , New York , to Florida and Boston to Austin , Texas , and New Orleans , St. George said .
The planes could eventually be flown on red - eye and daylight transcontinental service , and on red - eye service to the Caribbean , he said .
TODAY IN THE SKY : Say ' so long ' to Bombardiers CSeries jets ; they 're now ' Airbus A220s ' ( story continues below ) " There s a sizable chunk of the existing 190 flying that is really much better flown in a much larger aircraft , " St. George said . "
Some of these longer - haul routes ( are ) where we could really use these extra seats . "
The 60 A220s , which will replace 30 owned and 30 leased Embraer planes , will help convert the airline to an all - Airbus fleet , which JetBlue said would result in savings in crew training and maintenance .
The Airbus jets cost 29 percent less per seat to operate - including a 40 percent savings in fuel burn - than the existing Embraer planes , and they fly quieter with new Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines , officials said . "
This is a game - changer for JetBlue , " said Steve Priest , JetBlues chief financial officer .
JetBlue had announced Tuesday it ordered 60 Airbus A220 - 300 aircraft - planes that were previously called the Bombardier CS300 - for delivery beginning in 2020 .
The airline has an option for another 60 planes starting in 2025 that could be either A220 - 100 or -300 aircraft .
Compared to about 100 seats on the Embraer 190s , the A220 - 100s will have 120 seats and the A220 - 300 about 130 to 140 seats . "
We have a real opportunity to redefine the interiors , " Geraghty said .
The A220 decision did n't anticipate offering premium Mint seats that include lie - flat seats , which are n't available on the Embraer planes .
But Geraghty did n't rule out the possibility . "
This has been such a successful product for us that were always open to those ideas , " she said .
As part of the agreement , JetBlue converted an earlier order for 25 A320neos to the larger A321neo and adjusted the delivery schedule .
IN PICTURES : Bombardier 's CS300 completes first test flight ( story continues below ) JetBlues options during a 15-month fleet review was between larger Airbus 320 family or the next generation of A220 or Embraer 195 .
JetBlue officials offered cost comparisons to the existing 190 planes , but not the 195 . "
We had to make a very , very difficult decision , " Priest said . "
We believe the A220 is the perfect fit . "
The aircraft sparked an international trade dispute when Delta Air Lines ordered 75 of the version with 109 seats each .
The U.S. International Trade Commission found Canadian government support for Bombardier worth triple each planes price tag but declined to impose a tariff for lack of harm to Boeing , which did nt produce a similarly sized plane .
After the dust settled , Airbus had taken a majority stake in the Bombardier CSeries , with planes to be built in Mobile , Alabama , and Boeing had formed a joint venture with Brazilian regional - jet manufacturer Embraer .

JetBlues new routes to Mexico City from New York JFK and Boston are now on sale , the carrier announced Thursday .
The routes - each set to launch on Oct. 25 - will complement JetBlues existing service to Mexico City that it offers from both Fort Lauderdale and Orlando .
On the new routes from Boston and New York , JetBlue will offer one daily round - trip flight on Airbus A320 aircraft . "
Mexico City , the second largest city in the Americas and the largest city JetBlue flies to , is critically important as we continue to grow our footprint in Latin America and provide travelers with the award - winning JetBlue experience and low fares , " Giselle Cortes , JetBlues international cities chief , said in a statement .
JetBlue acquired the slots add flights to Mexico Citys capacity - controlled airport in 2017 , part of a divestiture made there by Aeromexico and Delta as those airlines sought regulatory approval for a joint - venture partnership .
FlightGlobal notes JetBlue originally planned to use its expanded Mexico City access from Long Beach , California .
However , JetBlue was forced to abandon that plan after the Long Beach City Council voted against a Customs facility for international flights . (

Eventually , JetBlue opted to seek regulatory approval to instead shift the Mexico City to its Northeast hubs at New York JFK and Boston , according to FlightGlobal .
However , JetBlue also will square off against numerous competitors in New York .
Four airlines already fly to Mexico City from JFK ( Aeromexico , Delta , Interjet and Volaris ) while a fifth ( VivaAerobus ) plans to begin service in mid - October .
United also flies to Mexico City from its hub at nearby Newark .
From Boston , JetBlues Boston - Mexico City service will go head - to - head with Aeromexicos existing non - stop flights .

Joe McDonald The Associated Press BEIJING -- BMW Group and the biggest Chinese SUV brand , Great Wall Motor , announced a partnership Tuesday to produce electric MINI vehicles in China as global automakers ramp up development under pressure from Beijing .
The companies said they signed an agreement Monday during an event in Berlin attended by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
BMW and Great Wall said their venture , Spotlight Automotive Ltd. , also will make electrics for the Chinese partner 's brand .
Great Wall put total investment in the venture at 5.1 billion yuan ( $ 770 million ) and said it is aiming for annual production of 160,000 vehicles .
Automakers are pouring billions of dollars into creating electric models for China , the biggest market for the technology .
Beijing is using access to its market as leverage to induce global automakers to help Chinese brands develop battery and other technology .
Auto brands in China are required to make electric vehicles at least 10 percent of their sales starting next year or buy credits from competitors that exceed their quotas .
Later , they face pressure to raise those sales in order to satisfy fuel efficiency requirements that increase annually .

That was more than double the U.S. level of just under 200,000 .
Other automakers including General Motors Co. , Volkswagen AG and Nissan Motor Co. have announced similar plans with Chinese partners to produce dozens of electric models .
Great Wall , headquartered in Baoding , southwest of Beijing , sells more than 1 million SUVs a year . "
With our joint approach , we can quickly scale up production and increase efficiency , " said Klaus Frolich , a BMW board member , in a statement .
MINI 's first battery electric model is due to be produced at its main British factory in Oxford in 2019 , according to BMW .
China is BMW 's biggest market .
The Munich - based automaker said about 560,000 BMW brand vehicles were delivered to Chinese customers in 2017 , more than its next two markets -- the United States and Germany -- combined .
China was MINI 's fourth - largest market in 2017 , with 35,000 vehicles delivered , the company said .
The electrics venture with BMW is an important boost for Great Wall , which industry analysts warned would struggle to satisfy Beijing 's sales quotas due to its fuel - guzzling vehicle lineup and had yet to announce any significant electric plans .
Joe Raedle | Getty Images If you ve ever carried a balance on a credit card thinking it would help your credit score , you re not alone .
About 43 million Americans , which is 22 percent of credit card users , have carried a balance to improve their credit score , according to a new CreditCards.com report .
The report surveyed 1,000 adults across the United States in June .
Unfortunately , carrying a balance is not one of the five main criteria that makes up a credit score , though how close you come to your spending limit is . "
This is the cockroach of finance myths , " said Matt Schulz , senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com . "
Impossible to kill . "
Extra interest Carrying a balance could hurt you in other ways , however .
For one , carrying a balance means that you are subject to paying unnecessary interest .
The average American has a balance of $ 6,375 , according to a study by Experian .
This from a year ago , and interest rates on credit cards have increased since then , as well .
The national average APR is over 16 percent , up a percentage point from 2017 , according to CreditCards.com . "
Its painful to know that so many millions of Americans are essentially attempting to pay their card issuers to improve their credit scores , " Schulz said .
Even if this were true and carrying a balance could improve your credit score , the boost would not be worth paying extra interest , said Schulz .
This is the cockroach of finance myths , impossible to kill .
Matt Schulz senior industry analyst , CreditCards.com In addition to burning a hole in your wallet , having a balance could also hurt your score if it grows too much .
One of the items that does comprise your credit score is your utilization rate , or debt - to - credit ratio .
The higher the amount of debt you have relative to your total amount of available credit , the worse this rate will be .
Pay your card on time The other big factor that goes into determining your credit score is payment history .
Paying on time is an issue for many credit card holders ; over 40 percent have paid a bill late , the CreditCards.com report found .
Nearly two - thirds of those were for no good reason such as they forgot , were busy or travelling .
The report looked at late payers by age , race , socioeconomic status and household size .
Women , minorities and parents with young children were found to be the most likely to pay late .
Millennials are also the most habitual late payers with 1 in 10 saying that they ve paid late five or more times .
While money was a factor in paying late , having more of it did n't seem to increase financial responsibility ; 35 percent of late payers said they did nt have enough money to pay on time , but higher earners were more likely to admit that they paid late because they were careless .
Credit does n't have to be complicated If you are looking to improve your credit score , Schulz says to be aware that you can not game the system .
To improve your score , the best things you can do are simple : Pay your credit card bill on time and in full every month .
He said that credit is a " marathon , not a sprint . " "
If you focus on the big picture and understand that you re playing a long game , you re going to end up doing the right thing , " Schulz said .
If you forget to pay bills on time , Schulz recommends setting up autopay for at least a portion of your bill . "
Because of technology , there s really no excuse for being late for payments anymore , " Schulz said .
If you focus on the big picture and understand that you re playing a long game , you re going to end up doing the right thing .

John Kelly was annoyed he could n't get a " full breakfast " in Brussels on Wednesday .
At least that was the explanation from White House spokesperson Sarah Sanders when asked about the apparently agitated body language displayed by President Donald Trump 's chief of staff during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg .
Sanders told The Washington Post that Kelly " was displeased because he was expecting a full breakfast and there were only pastries and cheese . "
A number of news outlets , including the Post , speculated that Kelly 's body language was related to the remarks Trump was making at the time about Germany being " totally controlled by Russia . "
Trump made the comment while voicing frustrations about how much Germany pays into NATO and the amount of Russian natural gas the country relies on .
Trump also said Germany , one of America 's closest allies , was " captive to Russia . "
Power breakfast : How Trump lambasted Germany over eggs and fruit salad More : Trump blasts US ally Germany as ' captive to Russia ' in tense opening of NATO summit The Post cited two body language experts , one of whom said Kelly appeared " displeased , maybe irritated " but was feeling " hardcore anger . "
The other said Kelly " looks like he wants to be anywhere but where he is . "
MSNBC 's Ari Melber said Kelly " looked ' noticeably perturbed ' during Trump 's remarks . " "
Just look at Kelly 's face throughout Trump 's Germany tirade , " tweeted Mother Jones magazine . "
It says everything . " "
Watch John Kelly search the room , his cup , his tie , for some reassuring sign this is all just a dream ... But it never comes .
It never comes , " tweeted Defense One tech editor Patrick Tucker .
On the other hand , The New Republic 's Jeet Heer said Kelly always looks like an " old disappointed cop in a movie who is 2 days away from retirement and just got shot by a mobster . "
Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol said Sanders ' explanation was " demeaning " and " infantilizing " for a man who " served his country as a Marine for over 40 years . "

John Schnatter , founder of Papa John 's Pizza , had a long day Wednesday .
First , Forbes reported in the morning that Schnatter had used the N - word during a conference call in May. By 5 p.m. , he had stepped down from University of Louisville 's board of trustees , and by 10:30 p.m. he was out as Papa John 's chairman .
More : Papa John 's Chairman John Schnatter resigns after apologizing for racial slur More : Fallout swift for John Schnatter at Papa John 's after he admits using N - word The internet , of course , caught on to the story in the morning and spent Wednesday roasting the pizza baron and internationally known Jeffersonville native .
And , as Robert Maguire of OpenSecrets.org pointed out on Twitter , the N - word does not mean " nutrition . "
The irony of it all , as one Twitter user pointed out , is that the latest Papa John 's public relations disaster happened on a conference call where Schnatter was practicing for future interviews about his response to racism and racist groups .
The Forbes story about Schnatter 's controversial comments was published Wednesday morning , and he was out at the University of Louisville just hours later .
Even TMZ had picked up the story by 10:30 p.m. - it 's never a good thing when you 're getting TMZ'd at 10:30 p.m. ( That is a sweet jacket though . )
University of Louisville has been no stranger to controversy after the past few years .
And with Schatter 's company 's name plastered on the school 's football stadium , some wondered what steps the university would take after the latest public relations nightmare .
Yahoo Sports columnist ( and former Courier Journal sportswriter ) Pat Forde had an interesting - and fitting - idea .
Schnatter threw himself into the debate about the NFL national anthem protests last year by claiming that the protests had curbed pizza sales .
Schnatter stepped down as CEO of Papa John 's at the beginning of the year after the backlash , which clearly has n't stopped since then .
For those boycotting the company , comedian and speechwriter Jon Macks had some sage advice : " Instead of ordering his pizza , just put some ketchup on a piece of cardboard and serve cold .
It 's healthier and tastes better . "
And , if he was n't already done , Matthew Cherry -- a filmmaker and NFL alum -- made it clear he had no more tolerance for Schnatter 's company .
To Twitter , neither Schnatter nor his pizzas have good taste .

Johnson & Johnson JNJ , +1.38 % shares rose 3.7 % in Tuesday morning trade after the company reported second - quarter earnings and revenue beats .
Earnings for the latest quarter rose to $ 3.95 billion , or $ 1.45 per share , from $ 3.83 billion , or $ 1.40 per share in the year - earlier period .
Adjusted earnings - per - share were $ 2.10 , above the FactSet consensus of $ 2.07 .
Revenue rose to $ 20.83 billion from $ 18.84 billion , above the FactSet consensus of $ 20.39 billion .
Pharmaceutical sales beat the consensus , with above - consensus sales for Simponi , Stelara , Prezisa / TMC , Concerta , Invega , Darzalex , Imbruvica and Zytiga , and below - consensus sales of Remicade , Edurant and Xarelto .
Sales of medical devices also came in above the consensus .
Yet consumer sales came in below consensus , with oral care and women 's health sales above consensus , while baby care , oral care , skin care and wound care sales were below consensus .
Johnson & Johnson now expects 2018 sales of $ 80.5 billion to $ 81.3 billion , reflecting an increase in expected operational growth and offset by an estimated lower favorable impact of currency ; the guidance is below the FactSet consensus of $ 81.4 billion .
Johnson & Johnson shares have dropped 0.7 % over the last three months , compared with a 3.3 % rise in the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % and a 1.1 % rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % .
Jonathan Gray , the president of alternative investment manager Blackstone Group L.P. BX , -2.69 % , on Wednesday encouraged investors to look beyond the short - term volatility that has at times rattled markets amid heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and its major trading partners .
Gray said Wall Street investors should instead focus on the economy 's strength . "
Waiting for an all - clear [ on the trade issue ] is a mistake , " he said at CNBC 's Delivering Alpha conference . "
The biggest focus should be on the strength of the U.S. economy , which is stronger than most people realize . "
He cited corporate profit growth and the labor market as support for his comments . "
There will be volatility , and there is risk " from the trade issue , " but in the fullness of time we 're hopeful it will be resolved . "
He added that " things are fluid " and that " things can change " in trade negotiations , but that it was in the interest of both the U.S. and its trading partners to avoid a full - on trade war .
Against that backdrop , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % is up 1.9 % so far this year and on track for a fifth straight gain on Wednesday , while the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % is position for a year - to - date return of 5.3 % and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , -1.83 % is currently up nearly 14 % thus far in 2018 .
Gray , a prominent executive in the company 's real estate division , replaced long - time Blackstone executive Tony James as president and COO back in February .
Jordan Belfort , the former stock broker made famous by Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese 's " Wolf of Wall Street , " is intimately familiar with scams .
He served 22 months in a California prison after pleading guilty in 1999 to a seven - year scheme at his Long Island brokerage , Stratton Oakmont , which manipulated the price of stocks and left investors holding nearly worthless securities .
According to Belfort , that experience has given him insight into a modern financial asset : Bitcoin . " [
Bitcoin ] is all based on the Great Fools Theory , ' ' Belfort says in a recent YouTube video . "
I know this better than anyone in the world .
I 'm not proud of that , but I do . "
Belfort says bitcoin 's price surges are thanks only to a belief by buyers that there will continue to be ' greater fools ' who they can sell the asset to at a higher price .
Bitcoin traded near $ 6,600 Monday morning according to data from Coindesk , a rebound from the cryptocurrency 's lows last month .
In 2017 , bitcoin soared from below $ 1,000 to over $ 19,000 in December , before plummeting at the start of this year . "
There 's no fundamental value [ with bitcoin ] , it 's all based on the next guy and the next guy , " he says . "
Get out if you do n't want to lose all of your money because ... there 's a very good chance it 's going to crack .
And when it really cracks , you 're not going to be able to sell on the way down , there will be no liquidity . "
Josh Smith Credit.com Nothing says adulting quite like hunting for your first post - college job .
Taking steps to embark on what should , by all indications , be an epic career journey , is equal parts exhilarating and terrifying .
While there are a litany of resources available that can help you search , apply and get hired for your dream job , there is less information out there that addresses the financial vulnerability of being a recent graduate who is also currently unemployed .
Its understandable that job hunting will be your first priority , but that s no reason to let your grip on your finances loosen .
Here are 10 ways to manage your finances while you re looking for that dream job : 1 .
Figure out your current financial situation Understanding your financial situation is paramount to getting through a bout of unemployment unscathed .
If you do nt know how much you have and how much you re spending , review bank statements , utility bills and any other record of financial transactions until you have a clear picture of how much money you re shelling out each month and on what .
This will help give you an idea of how long you can go on without income .

Create a budget Using the information garnered from your deep dive into your personal finances , create a realistic , but firm , budget .
Budgets should include all the monthly expenses you can count on , i.e. rent , utility bills , groceries , and a little money for play too -- because even without a job , you do nt want to go totally insane .
3 .
Stick to your budget !
No matter how hard it is , you have to stick to the budget .
These are times when every dollar counts .
So , buy the cheap beer , do nt get dessert , and ask your friends if they would nt mind just hanging out at home and binging Netflix .
Do nt get sucked into the cycle of spending what you do nt have .
This is a new financial reality , and while it wo nt last forever , the habits you develop during this period will .
4 .
Separate your wants from your needs In the spirit of sticking to your budget , figuring out what you do nt need to spend your money on is as important as figuring out what you do need .
Maybe you ve been getting your hair trimmed every 8 weeks .
Well , how about waiting 10 , or even 12 weeks between appointments ?
Or , maybe you always get your clothes dry cleaned .
Stick to the laundromat and save the professional press job for your next interview outfit .
5 .
Shop cheap There s no shame in being frugal .
Look for online sales and coupons to reduce the cost of groceries , and take a break from name - brand products in favor of generics .
Now is also the time to discover the magic of big - box retail warehouses like Costco and Sams Club .
Buying bulk - packaged essentials -- laundry detergent and shampoo , for instance -- will give your budget some much - needed breathing room .
You get more value for your dollar , and your products will last longer , too .
6 .
Use credit cards with caution You may be tempted to put all your unemployment purchases on your credit card , but doing so without a job offer on the table is a huge risk .
Though you re trying your best to get hired , there s no way of telling when that consistent paycheck will start rolling in .
Getting yourself too deep into credit card debt -- and subsequently damaging your credit score -- will have consequences .
7 .
Find things to do that are fun and free It might seem like not having a job is preventing you from living your best life , but you d be surprised to find out how many low - budget activities there are in your city .
Many libraries and park districts hold free events , like movie nights , that are open to the public .
Museums often offer free admission once a month .
With a little creativity and some research , you ll see that having a good time does nt have to cost a lot .
8 .
Consider rent - free living If you are nt already locked into a lease , consider crashing on a friends couch or with your parents until you lock down employment .
Living rent free will do wonders for your savings account , and allow you to sign a lease as a confident , stress - free new employee when the time is right .
9 .
Explore freelance work opportunities Two words : side hustle .
If you re harboring a secret talent -- or a car -- use it to your advantage and do some freelance work to rake in some income .
Graphic design , jewelry making , dog walking , ride sharing : its all good if its feeding back into your budget .
10 .
Do nt get desperate Being without income is stressful , but its important to remain level - headed .
When a job offer does come , do nt let the panic of your financial situation be the sole input on whether or not you accept .
Be pragmatic in your evaluation , which will help you determine if you actually want the job , if its a good offer , and if it makes the most sense for you .

Joyce M. Rosenberg The Associated Press The summer is high season for thieves claiming to be from the IRS and hoping to scam people out of their money .
That warning comes from the IRS , which notes that scammers use phone calls , emails and even in - person visits to try and scare people into turning over funds .
Scammers go after small businesses as well as individual taxpayers .
And they tend to strike in the summer because it 's just a few months after most people have filed their income tax returns , and when people can expect to hear from the IRS if the agency has a question about a return or if tax and/or penalties are owed .
But the government generally does n't start communicating with a taxpayer via email or phone calls , and IRS agents do n't show up at your business or home out of the blue .
As the agency spells out on its website www.irs.gov : " The IRS initiates most contacts through regular mail delivered by the United States Postal Service . "
More : Slim & Husky 's : ' Pizza beeria ' gives Nashville community a slice of fame More : Fast - growing Detroit startup StockX sniffs out fake sneakers More : Hard to do : Businesses may need to break up with slow - paying , irritating customers Unless you 've already been contacted by the IRS , and agreed that phone calls or emails are acceptable , it 's probably not the government you 're hearing from .
More dependence on cellphones has brought an increase in robocalls from scammers , with recorded messages , sometimes delivered in a loud , threatening tone and with scary - sounded words : " You must pay or face the consequences . "
The calls may demand that a taxpayer call a phone number and be prepared to give a credit card number .
In reality , the IRS sends paper bills if taxpayers owe money .
It also does n't demand that they use a specific payment method , and it does n't ask for credit or debit card numbers .
If you choose to pay with plastic , you have to use a payment processor listed on the IRS website .
The government also does n't ask for checks , but does say if a taxpayer wants to pay that way , the check should be made out to the U.S. Treasury and mailed to the address contained in the letter or bill you get .
FYI , it 's usually a post office box , and you probably will find the address on the IRS website too .
Also , the IRS must give you a chance to appeal the amount it claims you owe .
The IRS also does n't threaten people with arrest or having their driver 's licenses or immigration status revoked .
These are all scammers ' scare tactics .
Emailed demands and threats often contain links or attachments that , if clicked on , can infect a computer .
Falling for such a phishing scam could allow thieves to read your passwords and hack into your bank and other accounts .
And if your doorbell rings and it really is the IRS , chances are you 've already been in contact with the agency .
An IRS employee shows up at your business or home only if you 're being audited and it wants to inspect your premises , or if you 've refused to pay after a number of notices .
An IRS employee must carry and show two official credentials , according to the agency .
One is called a pocket commission and the other is an HSPD-12 card .
Ask to see them if someone claims to be from the government .
The IRS website has a lot more information -- search the site for " scam . "

JPMorgan Chase & Co. 's JPM , -0.59 % CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees few signs that strong domestic economic expansion in its ninth year will be buffeted by factors including Federal Reserve monetary policy and trade - war clashes .
Speaking Friday morning during a conference call with analysts to discuss the behemoth bank 's second - quarter results , Dimon said " you 're looking for potholes , there are not a lot of things out there , " responding to a question .
Dimon said the prospect of rising rates and a narrowing spread between the 2-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.583 % and the 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.434 % --watched as a gauge of a weakening economic outlook by bond buyers and as an accurate recession indicator , when the shorter rate exceeds its longer - term counterpart -- aren't creating a lot of consternation for the U.S. 's largest bank by market value .
Dimon 's comments come after JPMorgan JPM , -0.59 % reported a profit of $ 8.3 billion , or $ 2.29 a share , topping expectations of $ 2.22 a share among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters .
Overall profit at the corporate and investment bank was $ 3.2 billion , an 18 % increase from $ 2.71 billion in the same period last year .
JPMorgan 's trading revenue increased 13 % to $ 5.4 billion from $ 4.8 billion a year earlier .
Shares of the bank in the premarket were up 0.3 % and they are on track to climb 2.7 % for the week , as of Thursday 's close .
That compares with a 1.9 % weekly increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % , a weekly rise of 1.4 % for the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % and 1.8 % 5-day rise for the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , -1.83 % .
Meanwhile , the exchange - traded Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF , -1.11 % , which comprises some of the biggest U.S. financial institutions , was set to climb 1.6 % so far this week .
The results have come against the backdrop of an intensifying trade conflict between the U.S. and its trading partners across the globe and , notably China , and as the Fed has raised rates seven times since December of 2015 , in an attempt to return rates to precrisis levels .
That central - bank policy should contribute to improved profitability at banks but real rates have n't advanced as quickly as expected and the monetary strategies employed have contributed to a tightening gap between government paper that some fear could lead to an inversion of the yield curve , which has been an accurate predictor of recent recessions .

Just days after a Missouri State professor gained attention for her planned study comparing behavior , self - esteem and penis size , she shut the project down citing a backlash that would " threaten the reliability " of the data .
Now that professor , Alicia Walker , has written a piece describing the days after her study hit the internet .
She describes hateful messages and inaccurate portrayals of her work .
Walker penned an essay for " Feminist Reflections " on the website The Society Pages .
She describes frustration over national websites that missed the point , included incorrect information or used " click bait " headlines .
While she received many emails in support , there was also plenty of hate mail .
More : Professor 's ' penis size ' research project seeks 3,600 + explicit photos More : Sexual harassment : What it looks like online and what you can do about it " Each hater sent multiple emails , " she wrote . "
The first message came from a Michigan man ( he went to my academia.edu page , which provided his location ) -- he opened his email by calling me a ' feral whore . ' "
He sent 30 emails in total , each with similarly abusive language .
He called me a ' fat pig , ' or some variation , in most of those emails .
He even claimed that I was ' so fat only N --- s would ' have sex with me .
The racism of misogyny was common . "
Walker describes more of the abuse she received , but continues to make the case for the importance of her study . "
There is ample data demonstrating that for many men who perceive their penises are small , self - esteem is indeed an issue , " she wrote . "
How our bodies look and how we see them impacts how we feel about ourselves , and this is an important social and psychological issue .
My study could have contributed to this existing body of knowledge that takes mens bodies and feelings seriously , and it could have perhaps helped to shift methodology for penis size studies . "
Walker described the process and goal of the study to a News - Leader reporter last month .
More : What ' good sex ' really means to singles : Match Singles in America survey More : Take nude photos ?
What you can do to practice safer sexting She said the project looks at how penis size -- and , as importantly , a man 's perception of his penis size -- affects overall health , sexual activity , condom usage , self image , social interaction and mental health . "
So far I 'm hearing a lot of anxiety and a lot of low self - esteem related to size , " she said .
As part of the study , Walker had hoped at least 3,600 men -- from outside the Ozarks -- would fill out an online survey and upload photos of their genitalia .
The participants were required to be age 22 or older . "
These are not sexy pictures , " she said . "
These are clinical pictures . "
She said photos were necessary to ensure men carefully follow the instructions when measuring their flaccid and erect penis .
Missouri State initially confirmed Walker was conducting the study in a statement : " Academic freedom is a core component of a liberal arts university .
As such , faculty members have broad discretion in their research choices .
When students , staff and/or faculty conduct research at Missouri State University that involves human participants , they are required to submit an application to the Institutional Review Board . "

It is a legitimate area of research and she is conforming to all of the guidelines of participant security . "
Missouri State added the study was not funded by the university or any governmental institute .
The university also released the news that the study was ending .
The university said that " all submissions were stored in a secure research database " and that " none of the photographic submissions or survey responses have been or will be viewed .
They have already been destroyed . "
Just weeks after closing all its company - owned stores to conduct anti - bias training , a Philadelphia Starbucks is in hot water after a barista allegedly mistreated a customer with a speech impediment .
A worker at a cafe in University City is accused of mocking a man with a stutter , according to an NBC affliate .
Tan Lekwijit , a Wharton student , described the June 27 incident in a post on Facebook saying that his friend Sam , a 28-year - old University of Pennsylvania graduate student , stuttered when he told the barista his name after ordering a coffee .
The barista reportedly replied , " Okay , S - s - s - sam " and when Sam retrieved his coffee the cup had " SSSAM " printed on it . "
I am writing this not because I want to get anybody into trouble , but because I want to raise awareness among the employees , " Lekwijit wrote on Facebook . "
There are many people with speech disorders who are in a worse position than my friends and struggle with self - esteem and self - confidence .
Getting this kind of treatment from people , especially service employees , only scars them -- and I beg Starbucks employees to have this in mind . "
According to Lekwijit , Sam reached out to Starbucks Customer Service , which apologized and offered $ 5 in compensation . "
We want our stores to serve as a welcoming place for everyone who visits and want to ensure our partners provide a positive experience , " a Starbucks representative wrote on Lekwijit 's Facebook post . "
Our local leadership has reached out to Sam to better understand what took place and the specifics of his experience and apologize directly .
We have zero tolerance for discrimination and are addressing this immediately . "
In a statement to CNBC , Starbucks said : " Our local leadership has reached out to the customer to better understand what took place , the specifics of his experience , and to apologize for his experience directly . "
This incident comes just three months after two black men were arrested at a different Starbucks in Philadelphia after asking to use the restroom and not ordering anything while they waited for a friend to arrive .
In response , Starbucks conducted an afternoon - long anti - bias training session with more than 175,000 employees in May. The training hoped to raise awareness among its staff about subconscious biases they may hold against people of different races , ethnicities , religions , genders and sexual orientation .
The goal was to make Starbucks cafes more inclusive .
It was not immediately clear what , if anything , was said about disabilities .
The company announced earlier this week that it plans to roll out its new training program over the next year with six separate courses for managers and six for employees .
These additional training sessions will address engaging with empathy , gratitude and building diverse teams .
Separately , the New York Post reported Starbucks ' deputy general counsel in charge of ethics and compliance , Matthew Shay , a 21-year veteran of the company , retired at the start of June .
Starbucks told the paper the exit was planned .

Keep ' Em Laughing : Sebastian Maniscalco At age 44 , comedian Sebastian Maniscalco has turned his personal gripes with everyday life into a career , as one of standup comedy 's breakthrough performers .
His style is a unique blend of two of his early influences : the observational approach of Jerry Seinfeld , and the physicality of John Ritter .
Mark Strassmann talks with Maniscalco , author of the bestselling " Stay Hungry , " about what is at the heart of his humor : his very colorful family .
Ken Ritter Associated Press LAS VEGAS -- A twice - convicted killer scheduled to be executed Wednesday night in Nevada by an untried three - drug lethal injection is steadfast in his desire to be put to death , but a final - hour lawsuit by a drug company could halt the execution .
Pharmaceutical companies have resisted the use of their drugs in executions for 10 years , citing both legal and ethical concerns .
However , the legal challenge filed Tuesday in Nevada by New Jersey - based Alvogen is only the second in the U.S , said Robert Dunham , executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington , D.C. The previous challenge filed last year by a different company in Arkansas was unsuccessful in halting that execution .
Clark County District Court Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez scheduled a Wednesday morning hearing to decide if Scott Raymond Doziers execution can take place 11 hours later in the remote northeastern Nevada town of Ely .
A Nevada prisons spokeswoman declined to comment .
Alvogen says it does nt want its product used in " botched " executions .
It said in court documents that Nevada prison officials illegally obtained the sedative midazolam and demanded that it be returned and not used in Doziers execution . "
Midazolam is not approved for use in such an application , " the document said , adding uses of midazolam in other states " have been extremely controversial and have led to widespread concern that prisoners have been exposed to cruel and unusual treatment . "
Midazolam was substituted in May for expired Nevada prison stocks of diazepam , a similar sedative commonly known as Valium .
Nevadas first - of - its - kind execution protocol also calls for the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl to slow Doziers breathing and the muscle paralytic cisatracurium to prevent movement and stop his breathing .
Nevada refused Pfizers demand last year to return the companys diazepam and fentanyl , which has been blamed for overdoses nationwide but has not been used in an execution .
In the legal challenge in Arkansas last year , McKesson Corp. said it wanted nothing to do with executions and accused the state of obtaining vecuronium bromide , a drug used to stop inmates lungs , under false pretenses .
The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled against the company and allowed that execution to go forward , but legal questions about whether pharmaceutical companies can block use of their drugs in the death penalty have nt been resolved , Dunham said .
Dozier , who attempted suicide in the past , has said he prefers death to life behind bars . "
I ve been very clear about my desire to be executed ... even if suffering is inevitable , " Dozier said in a handwritten note to a judge who postponed his execution in November over concerns the untried drug regimen could leave him suffocating , conscious and unable to move .
Dozier repeated his desire to die during recent interviews with the Reno Gazette Journal and Las Vegas Review - Journal . "
Life in prison is nt a life , " the 47-year - old told the Review - Journal .
He has not responded to messages through his lawyers to speak with The Associated Press .
Dozier , son of a federal water engineer , grew up in Boulder City , Nevada , and attended high school in Phoenix .
He is an honorably discharged Army veteran ; a divorced father who became an emergency medical technician during his then - wifes high - risk pregnancy ; a pastels painter ; a landscaper ; and a methamphetamine user , maker and dealer .
He was close to his grandfather , who killed himself when Dozier was 5 .
He told a clinical psychologist who testified at his trial that he was sexually abused by a teenage male neighbor from ages 5 to 7 .
The psychologist diagnosed Dozier with anti - social personality disorder with narcissistic traits .
There s a limit to how much artwork and exercise a person can do in prison , Dozier said in court hearings and letters to Clark County District Judge Jennifer Togliatti , who postponed his execution last year .
Togliatti presided over the 2007 trial in which a Nevada jury decided Dozier should die for murder convictions in Arizona and Nevada in separate slayings of drug - trade associates , according to court records .
More : Death row interview : Scott Dozier says he is ready to be executed and reveals why Related : Nevada execution plan sedative blamed for troubles elsewhere In 2005 , Dozier was sentenced to 22 years in prison for shooting 26-year - old Jasen Greene , whose body was found in 2002 in a shallow grave outside Phoenix .
A witness testified that Dozier used a sledgehammer to break Greenes limbs so the corpse would fit in a plastic tote that Dozier used to transport meth , equipment and chemicals .
Dozier was sentenced to die for robbing , killing and dismembering 22-year - old Jeremiah Miller at a Las Vegas motel in 2002 .
Miller had come to Nevada to buy ingredients to make meth .
His decapitated torso was found in a suitcase in an apartment building trash bin , also missing lower legs and hands .
He was identified by tattoos on the shoulders .
His head was never found .
Relatives of Doziers victims are not expected at his execution , Nevada prisons spokeswoman Brooke Santina said .
Several Dozier family members are expected to attend .
Dozier suspended any appeals of his conviction and sentence , which would make him one of about 10 percent of the 1,477 inmates who gave up appeals and were executed nationwide since 1977 , according to the Death Penalty Information Center .
He did , however , let federal public defenders challenge the execution protocol drawn up last year by state medical and prison officials .
They argued the untried three - drug combination would be less humane than putting down a pet .
The judge invited state Supreme Court review , saying she expected the Nevada execution to be closely watched by officials in states that have struggled in recent years to identify and obtain drugs from pharmaceutical companies that do nt want their products used for the death penalty .
The state high court in May decided on procedural grounds that the execution could go forward but did not review the three - drug protocol that death penalty experts have characterized as experimental and risky . "
Because Nevada is using a combination of drugs that no one has used before , there is a lot about its protocol that we do nt know anything about , " Dunham said .
The midazolam is expected to render Dozier unconscious before he is injected with the fentanyl .
That will be followed by the muscle paralyzing drug .
Midazolam has been used with inconsistent results in states including Alabama , Arkansas , Arizona , Florida and Ohio .
Dunham noted the 2014 executions of Dennis McGuire in Ohio and Joseph Rudolph Wood III in Arizona left both inmates gasping and snorting before they died .
Nevadas last execution occurred in 2006 , when Daryl Linnie Mack asked to be put to death for his conviction in a 1988 rape and murder in Reno .

Kimberly Palmer NerdWallet When Court Harrington , a small - business owner in North Carolina , found himself unable to log into his bank account one day because the website was down , he was not happy about it .
When you ca nt access your money , he says , " the safety net we feel we have is not really there . "
Eventually he was able to log in , but he says the snafu cost him hours of wasted time and stress .
Harrington is among the millions of banking customers affected by website outages every year .
While a blip in access may just be an inconvenience to some , for customers racing to pay bills on time or requiring emergency cash , an outage can wreak financial havoc .
Delayed payments due to a website outage can result in late fees , interest on a missed credit card payment , or a lack of cash to pay for everyday expenses like food or rent .

Some Amazon Prime Day deals have already begun More : Why you might want to wrap your car key fob in foil And bank website outages are likely to become a bigger problem as banks increase their digital offerings , says Joe Fielding , a partner and banking expert at Bain , a management consulting firm . "
As they make those changes , the systems sometimes go down , " he says .
These six steps will help consumers protect themselves from the occasional outage .
1 .
Make sure its the bank and not you If your banks website is nt loading properly , its possible you have landed on the incorrect URL .
It might even be one intended to spoof the real website and capture your personal information .
Warren Taylor , co - founder and head of customer service for BankMobile , a branchless bank that operates online and through its mobile app , recommends bookmarking your banks URL on your computer so you do nt accidentally type in the wrong address .
And if you do land on a page that does nt look quite right , close the window and try again , double - checking that you have the correct address .
2 .
Use the mobile app instead Banks mobile apps and websites generally run on different sets of servers , so if one is down , the other should still work , says Paul Benda , senior vice president for risk management and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association , an industry group . "
If you have the mobile app , its like having a bank branch in your pocket , " he says . "
You can make sure everything is there , " as well as take care of paying bills or transferring funds .
If your bank has a physical branch , you could also make an in - person visit .
3 .
Check your banks social media posts Julie Conroy , research director for retail banking and payments at Aite , a financial services industry research company , recommends checking the banks official Twitter handle .
If you do nt see a message already posted , you can tweet at the bank to ask for an update .
Conroy also suggests calling the bank ; the number should be on the back of your debit card .
With widespread outages , though , the wait time might be long .
Third - party sites such as downdetector.com can also offer information , but the accuracy can vary by region .
4 .
Be on guard against fraudsters High - profile website outages are often followed by phishing attacks , where con artists email or call bank customers and elicit personal information from them . "
They leverage the chaos to trick [ consumers ] into giving up their credentials , " says Conroy .
If you receive any unsolicited emails from your bank , take a close look at them before you click or respond .
Accessing your bank through your bookmarked URL rather than a link embedded in an email will ensure you arrive at the right place .
5 .
Have a backup plan Given the inevitability of the occasional bank website outage , Fielding says consumers should make sure they have an alternative way to pay their bills , such as an emergency savings account with another financial institution , a prepaid debit card , or a credit card from a different bank . "
While most consumers ca nt keep multiple active primary checking accounts , you might at least have a contingency plan , " he says .
6 .
Do nt panic -- your money is safe Even if you ca nt access your bank account online , your money is still there , and its safe and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , says Benda . "
Your bank has spent a lot of effort to make sure everything you have is extremely well - protected .
Any interruption is temporary and likely to be fixed quickly , " he says .
While that might be cold comfort to a frustrated consumer facing a down website and a landlord who wants to be paid immediately , it should help to know that the hiccup will pass quickly .

Larry Bleiberg Special to USA TODAY Its one of the ironies of travel that while people will fly around the world to marvel at a site , folks living nearby never bother to visit .
Jamie Wong , founder and CEO of Vayable.com , says there are reasons . "
There s a lack of scarcity , always a feeling you can visit tomorrow . "
And there s also a hip factor , wanting to avoid the places that attract tourists .
Wong , whose app connects travelers with local guides around the world , shares sites that are worth visiting , even if locals do nt know it .
The Getty Center Los Angeles In a city focused on popular entertainment , classical art and culture are often overlooked .
Perhaps that s why many locals miss this gorgeous museum and garden complex tucked away above the 405 Freeway .
Do nt make the same mistake , Wong says . "
You got up there and you feel transported .
You could be in Italy , but you re in Los Angeles .
The panoramic views are stunning .
Its a really interesting mix of old and new . "
getty.edu Niagara Falls New York and Canada Niagara Falls has attracted tourists for centuries , but locals often do nt bother to make the trip .
Bad call , Wong says . "
Skip the bus tours .
You do nt need to bring a selfie stick .
Its one of those destinations that s magical . "
niagarafalls.ca , niagarafallsusa.com Graceland Memphis , Tennessee Even if you re not an Elvis fan , there s a reason to visit his home , Wong says . "
It tells the story of American culture and celebrity .
It would be a huge mistake to miss this part of our history . "
Although locals understand Elvis importance , they rarely visit . "
You ca nt really separate Memphis from Graceland , but they also stay far , far away . "
memphistravel.com Architecture river cruise Chicago Chicago is where the skyscraper was invented and remains a showroom for the worlds top architects .
But folks who live and work here tend to overlook the citys legacy . "
Its so easy to get distracted and forget to look around and appreciate what s around you , " says Wong .
The scenery is best from a cruise on the Chicago River . "
Its pretty unreal , its unlike anything you can do anywhere else . "
choosechicago.com Colonial Williamsburg Virginia In an era of divisive , cutthroat politics , people have become jaded about our countrys early years , Wong says .
But this restored colonial capital and its living - history programming makes our past both relevant and accessible . "
There are nt many places where you can really go and experience a historic moment in time . "
colonialwilliamsburg.com Pearl Harbor Honolulu While Hawaii evokes images of beaches , surfing and hula dancing , Wong suggests leaving time for World War II history .
The bombing of Pearl Harbor propelled America into the global conflict , although it may be a faded memory for many residents . "
Its a fascinating piece of history that has so many different threads , and its just an afternoon trip , a respite from the beach and sun . "
gohawaii.com Lincoln Memorial Washington , D.C. For Washingtonians , the citys memorials and statues are often just a backdrop in their daily lives .
Visitors know better .
Wong says the monuments humanize the larger - than - life leaders who created and guided the country .
Her favorite site is the Lincoln Memorial . "
Not only is it stunningly beautiful and iconic , but it makes the history real and Abraham Lincoln real . "
Washington.org Golden Gate Bridge San Francisco Locals may use the Golden Gate every day , but they take it for granted , says Wong , who was raised in the area , and lives there now . "
No one walks across it or appreciates it for its beauty and for its historic value . "
But its a highlight for visitors , who explore the trails that lead up to the span and take in views from the walkway .
sftravel.com Freedom Trail Boston Boston almost has too much history for visitors , with connections to the Colonial era and Revolutionary War at every turn .
Residents may not notice it , but luckily , the city makes it easy to track the stories with a marked 2.5-mile trail , visiting sites like Boston Common , Paul Reveres home and the Bunker Hill Monument . "
Its like being in a time machine while letting you engage in the modern Boston of today , " says Wong .
bostonusa.com Sleepy Hollow New York Although just 30 miles from Manhattan , few New Yorkers ever make it to this literary landmark .
The village is most famous as the setting of Washington Irving 's short story " The Legend of Sleepy Hollow , " with the legendary Headless Horseman .

LAS VEGAS - UFC light heavyweight Khalil Rountree has always looked to fans for inspiration and support .
When he did nt get that in advance of his recent UFC 226 fight with Gokhan Saki , he had to look inward for motivation . "
I needed this for myself , " Rountree ( 6 - 2 MMA , 2 - 2 UFC ) said after his upset knockout of Saki ( 1 - 1 MMA , 1 - 0 UFC ) in Saturdays pay - per - view opener at T - Mobile Arena in Las Vegas . "
So what it felt was just like I knocked a big demon off my shoulder , like , OK , what s next ? "
Or maybe a bunch of little demons .
Rountree said his social - media timeline was invaded pre - fight with Saki fans who promised he d wind up unconscious .
When the opposite happened , he did nt feel like gloating .
He just felt relieved . "
I ve dealt with a lot , so for it to finally be over , I m not like , ' Hurray !
But I m like , ( sigh ) , " Rountree said . "
Now I can continue .
I got a win , got some extra money , can take care of my family the way that I want to , and move forward . "
Rountree does nt put too much stock in his new mindset moving forward .
Although did a lot of things different to prepare for the fight with the ex - kickboxing champ , like not devising a meticulous gameplan for every moment of the fight , hell let the " flow of life " dictate his next approach .
By not having any set path , he managed to find the best one in the octagon .
He said the left straight that knocked Saki to the canvas was nt planned . "
I do nt even think I looked at him , " Rountree said . "
I think I just stepped in and threw a left just in case he was in the area .
But when I saw him drop , I kind of took my time , because in the past , I ve rushed into things . "
Now , Rountree can take his time moving into his next fight .
After being forced to wait for the opportunity to fight Saki courtesy of an injury , he plans to learn and grow more as a fighter in the coming months .
That s a process hell do for himself , and not the approval of those watching him .

LAS VEGAS -- The NBAs one - and - done rule is unofficially done .
Commissioner Adam Silver made it clear on Tuesday that there is growing support for a change that would allow players to enter the league at the age of 18 rather than require them to play one year of college basketball - or internationally .
Such a move would have to be collectively bargained with the National Basketball Players Association , but Silvers tone on this topic was the strongest sign yet that its only a matter of time . "
My personal view is that were ready to make that change , " Silver said after the conclusion of the latest round of owners ' meetings . "
It wo nt come immediately , but ... when I weighed the pros and cons - ( and ) given that ( former Secretary of State ) Condoleezza Rice and her ( NCAA ) commission has recommended to the NBA that those one - and - done players now come directly into the league and , in essence , the college community is saying ' We do not want those players anymore , I mean that sort of tips the scale in my mind that we should be taking a serious look at lowering our age to 18 . "
More : Steph Curry set for celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe More : Michele Roberts re - elected as executive director of NBPA If this momentum continues as so many expect , the rule that has been in place since 2006 would be no more .
Silver sent a memo to teams in mid - June indicating the change would not come any earlier than the 2021 draft , and that timeline appears to still be in tact .
Silver and NBPA executive director Michele Roberts met in November to discuss the topic , not long after the FBIs investigation into college basketball sparked the Rice - led commission that appears to have turned this tide .
As Silver indicated , the leagues owners discussed the matter at the Vegas meetings . "
We did discuss that , both with the labor relations committee and with the board , and ... the sense was we should be engaging with the Players Association on the minimum age to come into the NBA , and we presented the pros and cons of going from 19 to 18 , in conjunction with that presentation we discussed a lot about the development of younger players prior to them coming into the professional ranks , " Silver said . "
We ve had several discussions with both the NCAA and USA Basketball about engaging with them , with players , beginning roughly at 14 years old , and especially with those elite players ( who ) we know statistically have a high likelihood , when they re identified at that age , of being top tier players , of coming into the league .
So I think the next step will be to sit down with the Players Association . "
Last year , Airbnb partnered with the NAACP to help encourage more people of color to list their properties on the short - term rental site .
The hope was that this would benefit not only African - American and Hispanic property owners , but also nearby businesses given that 50 % of guest spending occurs in the neighborhoods where guests stay , according to Airbnb .
However , the spillover spending effect is much greater in predominantly white neighborhoods compared to black or Hispanic neighborhoods , according to a study published this week by Purdue University Krannert School of Management professor Mohammad Saifur Rahman and Ph.D. student Mohammed Alyakoob .
Users of the home - sharing platform generally eat at local restaurants near where they are staying .
In fact , the study authors found that the presence of Airbnb guests in a neighborhood increased restaurant employment rates in response to increased demand , driven in part by Yelp reviews .
Ultimately , the researchers estimate that this translated into $ 1 million of additional tourism activity in contrast to ten years prior when Airbnb did not exist in New York City .
That economic effect is not realized , however , in neighborhoods where 50 % or more residents are of black or Hispanic origin .
Here 's what most investors get wrong about disruption Initially , Rahman said that his team was mainly interested in seeing if Airbnb produces an economic spillover effect on local restaurants .
To measure the economic impact the researchers analyzed employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics , Airbnb , as well as 3.5 million Yelp reviews corresponding to more than 34,000 restaurants in New York City .
Analyzing the Yelp reviews helped them understand how guests are selecting restaurants . "
When we focus on the predominantly white areas , the estimates suggest that there is a 4 % employment increase in the service industry in response to a 2 % increase in Airbnb activity , " said Rahman . "
In contrast , our estimates suggest that in predominantly black or Hispanic areas , despite Airbnb activity , guests are nt going to restaurants at the significant level that would cause them to hire more employees . "
Nick Papas , an Airbnb spokesman , disputed the findings of the Purdue research , which he said was " deeply flawed . "
He said , " Any rigorous analysis should compare the traditional hospitality industry to new accommodation choices . "
He also pointed out that Airbnb has surged in the predominantly black neighborhoods of Washington , D.C. However , it is not clear why guests are not spending as much money in minority neighborhoods .
Rahman recommends that Airbnb partner with more hosts to actively promote local restaurants to their guests .
Late last year Nordstrom opened the first Nordstrom Local on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles .
The store , roughly 3,000 square feet , has a nail salon , a bar stocked with beer and wine , a seamstress and ample fitting rooms .
But you ca nt buy any clothes there .
You can have online orders shipped to Nordstrom Local for pickup , but the goal is for the smaller spaces to be experiential and service - oriented .
The company said Monday , ahead of its investor meeting in West Hollywood , California , that it will open at least two more Nordstrom Local shops in Los Angeles and is eyeing New York for expansion .
The expansion for Nordstrom comes at a time when retailers across the U.S. are grappling with how to compete in the age of Amazon and as more shoppers are ringing up purchases online .
Nordstrom in particular has many locations at shopping malls , which are seen as less appealing to some consumers today . "
Nordstrom is continuing to invest in its growth strategy with the goal of increasing market share by providing customers with better and more convenient services and access to more products , " Ken Worzel , president of Nordstrom.com and its chief digital officer , said in a statement .
He said the company has been able to combine " the scale of our national infrastructure with our local assets of people , product , and place to help reimagine the shopping experience . "
Seattle - based Nordstrom has said Los Angeles is the department store chains largest market , with more than a dozen full - line locations scattered across town .
Shea Jensen , senior vice president of customer experience at Nordstrom , said at the ShopTalk conference in Las Vegas earlier this year that the company was learning a lot from its shop on Melrose Avee . ,
which would help it ahead of a grander rollout .
Nordstrom said the new locations in Los Angeles -- one in Brentwood and one downtown -- would be tailored specifically to those neighborhoods .
It has nt yet revealed an address for a New York store but is in the process of constructing its first full - line department store for women in the city .
It just opened a mens shop near The Shops at Columbus Circle earlier this year .
On Tuesday , Nordstrom will hold a meeting with investors and give them a tour of the Nordstrom Local on Melrose Avenue .
Industry analysts are hoping to learn more about the companys goal for the smaller stores and receive an update on its progress with its off - price business , Nordstrom Rack , which has been struggling of late . "
As the retail landscape remains highly competitive and challenging , we admire the initiatives that Nordstrom continues to implement to solidify its place as a best - in - class multi - channel retailer , " Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey said in a note to clients Monday morning . "
However , earnings growth for at least the medium - term appears muted due to softer top - line performance and margin pressure from investments in long - term growth initiatives , among other factors . "
Nordstrom shares are up more than 12 percent so far this year .
But on Monday they were trading down nearly 2 percent , just below $ 53 .
Over the past year , the stock has traded as high as $ 54.11 and as low as $ 37.79 .

Lauren Zakalik WFAA - TV , Dallas - Fort Worth SANGER , Texas -- A Texas Army veteran and his wife are considering getting a divorce in order to qualify for Medicaid and alleviate some of the costs of their daughter 's healthcare .
Maria and Jake Grey of Sanger have a daughter with a rare chromosomal disorder .
Even with health insurance , the Greys spend upwards of $ 15,000 a year out of pocket on her health care .
The Greys , who now live in Sanger , have two little girls : Fairen , who s two , and Brighton , who s six -- but developmentally is still a baby .
The family calls Brighton a beautiful blessing .
Caring for her is something they feel blessed to do , but it has been difficult .
More:'I ca n't afford that ' : Woman trapped by subway train begs bystanders not to call ambulance More : What do you do when you ca n't afford the ' American dream ' ?

You know , when you have a newborn , everything gets really stressful .
You really have to adapt to someone needing you 24/7 , all the time , " Maria explained . "
We ve had a newborn for six - and - a - half years . "
Brighton has Wolf - Hirschhorn Syndrome , a rare chromosomal disorder that s left her needing full - time care .
She has hearing and vision impairment , seizures , heart and kidney problems and more .
The syndromes effects on their daughter have also left them financially fragile . "
I used to get anxiety just opening the mail because I was scared of what would come or what bill would come or what denial would come , " Maria said through tears .
Even with health insurance , the family says they spend up to $ 15,000 each year out of pocket for Brightons care .
That s more than 30 percent of their annual income .
Because Jake , an Army veteran , makes about $ 40,000 a year , the family does nt qualify for Medicaid .
And while there is state assistance available , there are tens of thousands of people on the waiting lists .
Some have been waiting up to 14 years .
On one list , Brighton is number 59,979 , the family says .
So the Greys are considering something extreme in order to afford their childs care . "
It would just be to get a divorce .
It would be to not be together to get our child what we need , " Maria said .

We ve just struggled and struggled with it , and now we ve gotten to the point , where we feel its a real possibility , " Jake said . "
For a family like this , they really are in a tough spot , " said Dr. Thad Miller , a health care policy expert at UNT Health Science Center in Fort Worth .
He said the average American spends about $ 600 on health care a year .
We asked him to compare that to what the Greys spend caring for their daughter . "
Its very high , " he said , calling it " extreme . "
Dr. Miller says he s never known a family to get a divorce because of circumstances like these .
But he believes there are many , many other families in this very same position , especially considering the numbers of people on the assistance waiting lists . "
It 's just shocking , and I really think it speaks to our need to really rethink what we do and how especially for the most vulnerable , " Dr. Miller said . "
For someone to kind of make you choose between your marriage and your child is just -- it 's just a really weird spot to be in , " Jake said .
But they fear they have no choice . "
It 's morally wrong I feel like , and I think it 's conflicting for me too , because I feel like what 's happening to us is morally wrong , " Jake said .

We should ve been married outside that day , but it rained , " said Jake Grey as he looked at his wedding photos with his wife Maria . "
Then we got the rainbows , " Maria said .
For the Greys , the meaning behind their vows has only gotten stronger with every passing year . "
We would nt have made it this far without each other , that s for sure , " Maria said . "
I ca n't imagine going through what we ve been through with anybody else , " Jake said .
They just never imagined that could mean a divorce .

Lena Dunham is happier at a higher weight .
The star , writer and producer of HBO 's " Girls " posted side - by - side photos this week on Instagram : an earlier one where she says she weighed 138 pounds and a later one at 162 .
In the accompanying text , she says she 's doing better at the higher weight , counter to the reaction one might traditionally expect .
She offers a compelling rationale with the accompanying minuses and pluses : " On the left : 138 pounds , complimented all day and propositioned by men and on the cover of a tabloid about diets that work .
Also , sick in the tissue and in the head and subsisting only on small amounts of sugar , tons of caffeine and a purse pharmacy . "
Commenting on the second picture , she says : " On the right : 162 pounds , happy joyous & free , complimented only by people that matter for reasons that matter , subsisting on a steady flow of fun / healthy snacks and apps and entrees , strong from lifting dogs and spirits . "
She acknowledges the pull of traditional expectations but says she 's happy with the additional weight : " Even this OG body positivity warrior sometimes looks at the left picture longingly , until I remember the impossible pain that brought me there and onto my proverbial knees .
As I type I can feel my back fat rolling up under my shoulder blades .
I lean in . "
Her message appeared to reach a receptive audience .

Further more ( sic ) , I have not had any direct contact with any of the people involved in months . "
In a graphic post on Instagram ( since deleted ) -- the picture showed a woman who was cut and bruised on the face -- he was accused of the following : " @shadymccoy is THE DEVIL ! ! !

Jacoby Hudson , an Atlanta - based lawyer who represented McCoy in eviction proceedings against the woman shown injured on Instagram , told USA TODAY Sports that McCoy had n't lived at the residence in Alpharetta , Ga. , for months . "

The Milton ( Ga. ) Police Department said in a statement Tuesday that they are investigating a " targeted " home invasion earlier that morning . "
When officers arrived they found one victim who had been physically assaulted by a lone intruder , " police said in the statement . "
During the altercation , the suspect demanded specific items from the victim .
An adult female victim was treated and released at North Fulton Regional Hospital .
A second adult female victim also sustained a minor injury during the incident . "
Hudson said McCoy was in Miami at the time of the incident .
In court documents , the victim previously said that she was living in the home with her two children .
Tanya Mitchell Graham , the attorney representing the the victim of the attack , said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports and other outlets that her client was asleep when a man " entered the home with no signs of forced entry " and " demanded specific items of jewelry . "
Graham alleged that an eviction notice on behalf of McCoy was wrongly given to the woman 's 16-year - old son and thus ca nt be enforced .
Another Georgia lawyer , Michael LaScala , now represents McCoy in the eviction process , which was scheduled for court Tuesday .
The hearing was postponed at the earlier request of Graham , who was dealing with a family emergency .
McCoy , who 's set to enter his 10th NFL season , has had legal issues in the past .
He was sued by two off - duty Philadelphia police offers in 2016 for his alleged role in a bar fight but was never charged with a crime .
McCoy was also sued in 2013 for an alleged assault of a woman that occurred on a party bus in New Jersey . * * *

LONDON -- The U.S. Embassy in Britain issued a warning Tuesday for Americans in London to keep a low profile in case protests planned this week against President Donald Trump 's visit turn violent .
The embassy noted that numerous demonstrations will be held Thursday through Saturday , and " several of the events are expected to attract large crowds . "
People should " exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings that may become violent . "
Tens of thousands of protesters plan to march against Trump when he meets Friday with British Prime Minister Theresa May and with Queen Elizabeth II .
But the president is unlikely to actually see the demonstrations .
Woody Johnson , the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom , said Trump will travel by helicopter between locations , but that is not to steer clear of any protests . "
The president is not avoiding anything .
The president is merely trying to get as impactful a trip as he can get within a 24-hour period , " Johnson said .
Mays office announced last week that Trump will largely avoid London during his trip , which comes on the heels of the NATO summit held in Brussels on Wednesday and Thursday .
May will host Trump and first lady Melania Trump at a black - tie dinner Thursday at the opulent Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire - about 60 miles outside of London - before the couple spend the night at the U.S. ambassadors residence in Regents Park in central London .
Trump on Friday holds talks on foreign policy with May at Chequers , the prime ministers country home in Buckinghamshire - 47 miles outside London - before meeting Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle - 26 miles from the capital .
Trump and the first lady then spend the weekend in Scotland , where Trump owns two golf courses .

Other groups also plan protests , including a march in central London on Friday billed as Together Against Trump . "
Its funny , he s running scared from us that he wo nt show his face in London , " said Stop Trump Coalition spokesperson Zoe Gardner .
Protests will be happening " all over , " she said . "
He wo nt be able to escape it . " "
There s a huge level of opposition that exists in this country to the type of politics that he represents , " she added .
Gardner said the rallies are also against the British authorities who invited the U.S. president to visit .
Gardner said the Stop Trump Coalition wants the British government to " take a firm stance against Trumps racist policies " on immigrationand " take a strongly moral line " on climate change , womens rights and migrants ' rights .
London Mayor Sadiq Khan , the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital , has openly feuded with Trump over the president 's proposed travel ban against Muslim nations .
Khan recently approved the use a 20-foot inflatable balloon that resembles Trump to fly in central London during his visit .
The diaper - clad , smartphone - clutching blimp , called " Trump Baby , " has raised more than $ 30,000 through a crowdfunding appeal , enough for it to go on a world tour , the organizers said .
The British political band called Captain SKA had a Top 10 hit last year with " Liar Liar , " which the group said was about the prime minister .
Captain SKA remixed the song to feature Trump . "
We released it to highlight the dangers of Trump and Trumpism , " said Jake Painter , 39 , a producer and trumpet player with the London - based band .
The move came after the Trump administration announced its " zero tolerance " immigration policy separating children from their parents at the Mexican border . "
We thought this is the biggest liar the world has ever seen " and decided to release the song , Painter said .

Lora Kolodny CNBC Tesla is taking orders for its Model 3 electric sedans throughout the U.S. and Canada , no reservations required .
Previously , would - be Model 3 owners had to put down a $ 1,000 deposit to secure a place in line to buy the car .
Now , anyone in North America can order one via Tesla 's website .
Those who reserved a Model 3 early helped Tesla get a sense of the market 's demand for the cars well before the company was manufacturing them .
Their Model 3 deposits also gave Tesla something of an interest - free loan .
Reservation holders and new customers alike must pay a $ 2,500 deposit to move their Model 3 orders forward .
The deposits go toward the overall cost of their cars .
The $ 2,500 to $ 3,500 total deposit becomes nonrefundable once Tesla assigns the customer a vehicle identification number , typically within a few days of their order .
Tesla has required $ 2,500 deposits from people buying its earlier Model S and Model X vehicles .
Customers who sought refunds -- both on their $ 1,000 reservation and $ 2,500 deposits -- in recent weeks shared correspondence with CNBC that showed Tesla repays reservations in about two weeks , but refunds the $ 2,500 deposits directly to their credit cards within a few days .
The company also said orders for the Model 3 will be fulfilled in priority order based on a mix of factors including : whether or not a customer had a reservation , the date of their order , their selected vehicle configuration and the location of delivery , the company said .
When it makes new Model 3 options available , Tesla intends to give reservation holders priority to buy those cars first .
Some reservation holders are waiting for the base version of the Model 3 , which Tesla promised to sell for a very accessible price of $ 35,000 .
Others are waiting for Dual Motor and Dual Motor Performance versions of the Model 3 .
So far , Tesla has produced versions with premium features , such as longer range , a higher top speed and all - wheel drive , which cost between $ 49,000 and $ 72,000 .
Tesla ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $ 2.7 billion .
It said then that it still expects to spend $ 3 billion .
Deposits for Model 3 vehicles could give Tesla some of the cash that it needs without having to further dilute earnings through stock sales or by issuing debt .
Encouraging customers to commit to higher - priced , premium Model 3s could also help Tesla in its quest to attain profitability this year .
In its most recent quarterly filing , Tesla noted that " Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied towards the customers purchase balance . "
Tesla recognizes deposits as revenue only once the customer picks up their car and the full purchase is made , or when they cancel their order , if its past the point when they d be able to get a refund . (

LOS ANGELES - It is to Hollywood what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris and the Empire State Building is to New York City .
The ultimate selfie spot .
The Hollywood sign .
However , unlike those two popular landmarks , visitor access is an issue .
The neighbors who live closest to the sign have complained loudly about tourists invading their spaces , and have worked with city officials to make parking nearest the Hollywood sign viewing areas off - limits to non - residents without permits on weekends and holidays .
They 've even put up signs encouraging tourists to turn away .
This week the movie studio Warner Bros. proposed a better way .
The studio , home to the " Batman , " and " Harry Potter " films , and TV shows like " The Big Bang Theory , " proposed building an aerial tram that would bring tourists from the studio lot to a viewing area .
The " Hollywood Skyway " would " reduce street congestion , improve safety , and ease neighborhood frustrations , " the studio said . "
Given our close proximity to the north side of the Hollywood sign , we believe we offer a solution that has the least impact on the environment - protecting and preserving Griffith Park - and the surrounding residential neighborhoods . "
The Los Angeles Times cites the cost of the project at $ 100 million .
Warner Bros. had no comment beyond the statement .
The proposal would have to be considered by the city of Los Angeles and the parks departments .
The tramway from Warner Bros. would be a six - minute ride up to the back of Mount Lee , one of the main viewing areas for the sign , to a new visitor center .
Like neighbor Universal Studios , Warner Bros. now offers studio back lot tours as well for a fee .
The official viewing spot , per the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce , is the Hollywood and Highland Mall on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , which offers a super wide - angle glimpse of the sign from the fourth floor deck .
Motivated tourists who want to get right up close to the sign can drive up Beachwood Canyon or to Lake Hollywood Park for a closer view .
Or they can go to Griffith Park , where they can hike to the back of the Hollywood sign .
However , the sign is covered up with a chain - link fence , so selfies have to be artfully composed , by holding the camera up high .

LOUISVILLE , Ky. - After a day in which he admitted he used a racial slur , John Schnatter resigned from the company he built .
Papa John 's International announced late Wednesday that Schnatter had resigned as chairman .
The company will appoint a new chairman in " in the coming weeks . "
The resignation ends a day which began with a story from Forbes in which Schnatter was said to have used the N - word on a call with a public relations firm that was designed to help the company avoid more public relations issues .
By 2 p.m. , nine hours after the Forbes story was published online , Schnatter , the pizza baron and self - made billionaire , released a statement admitting he 'd used the slur and apologizing . "
News reports attributing the use of inappropriate and hurtful language to me during a media training session regarding race are true , " Schnatter said . "
Regardless of the context , I apologize .
Simply stated , racism has no place in our society . "

Depends on who you ask .
Papa John 's is one of America 's most polarizing brands Schnatter then resigned from the University of Louisville board .
The mayor of Jeffersonville , Indiana , had Schnatter 's name removed from a historic fieldhouse that he had donated $ 800,000 to restore .
After the donation , the Nachand Fieldhouse had been renamed in Schnatter 's honor in his hometown of Jeffersonville , Schnatter 's remark set of outrage all over social media and with several groups , including the NAACP calling for Schnatter to resign from the University of Louisville board prior to it happening .
Schnatter 's meteoric rise , launched from the closet of his father 's failing Jeffersonville bar in 1984 , is integral to the Papa John 's story .
The business has grown to become a publicly traded international franchise with more than $ 1 billion in annual sales .
Papa John 's franchises over 4,700 stores , 3,500 in the U.S. and over 1,200 in nearly 40 other countries and territories .
Schnatter , who owns roughly $ 700 million in company stock , is seen on pizza boxes and , until the last few months , in many Papa John 's TV spots where he 's rubbed elbows with NFL stars like retired quarterback Peyton Manning .
The Forbes ' story cited a source alleging that Schnatter was asked during a May conference call to role - play through scenarios to help him learn to respond to questions about racial issues .
Asked how he would distance himself from racist groups online , Schnatter was quoted as saying that Colonel Harland Sanders had referred to blacks using the N - word , but the Kentucky Fried Chicken founder never faced a backlash .
But instead of saying " N - word , " Schnatter used the offensive word .
The report said Schnatter " also reflected on his early life in Indiana , where , he said , people used to drag African - Americans from trucks until they died . "
The reference apparently was meant to show that he found racism deplorable , but the Forbes source said that multiple people on the call were offended .
The owner of Laundry Service , the marketing firm working with Schnatter , had terminated its contract with Papa John 's after it learned about the comments .
Loup Ventures ' Gene Munster predicts the embattled automaker will be profitable by September .
CEO Elon Musk announced Tesla aims to produce 6,000 Model 3s per week by August , but Munster says September is a safer bet . "
This 5,000 production number was the first time in about nine months he 's gotten one right .
I think it 's safe to always dial back what he 's saying , that 's why we think [ Tesla 's ] going to meet the production number by the end of the September quarter , " Munster said on CNBC 's " Fast Money . " "
If they hit that number , it 's going to equate to 48,000 model 3s produced in the September quarter .
That should get them to profitability , slightly profitable , " Munster said . "
It 's not going to be wildly profitable in September , I just want to warn everyone , but ... it moves them in the right direction . "
After repeatedly pushing back targets , Tesla vowed in January to build 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery - powered sedan .
Tesla finally met its goal in the final week of the quarter , with the final car rolling off the assembly line on Sunday morning .
Despite Tesla 's weekend production beat , the stock ended down more than 2 percent on Monday , which Munster said initially surprised him . "
The bears have their case to say that even though that 5,000 number was pretty , they had to throw everything at it to get there -- the reality is they have n't ramped , " Munster said .
Tesla 's future as a mass - market automaker hinges on efficient , automated production of the mid - priced Model 3 .
Production of the Model 3 has been plagued by a number of issues , including excessive automation in factories and battery issues .
Delays may have already compromised Tesla 's monopoly on the mid - priced electric vehicle , as competitors prepare to launch rival models .
Luke Hancock said he ca n't go more than two days without somebody asking him if he had strippers in his college dormitory .
To the former Louisville basketball star , those interactions are evidence of his sullied reputation , a lingering effect of an NCAA investigation and sanctions tied to the escort scandal at the University of Louisville .
A lawsuit filed against the NCAA on Wednesday by five former University of Louisville men 's basketball players is an attempt to redeem reputations .
The five plaintiffs -- former Louisville players Hancock , Gorgui Dieng , Stephan Van Treese , Tim Henderson and Michael Marra -- are seeking " a declaration that they are completely innocent of any wrongdoing as implied by the NCAA , " according to the lawsuit , which was filed in Jefferson Circuit Court .
The suit accuses the NCAA of portraying members of the 2013 team in a false light and seeks to restore the team 's 2013 national championship and associated accolades , which were vacated by the NCAA along with 123 wins as a result of the escort scandal . "
Peoples reputations matter , " said attorney Keith Mitnik , who is representing the players .
Hancock , flanked by eight attorneys , was the lone player present Wednesday at a news conference to discuss the lawsuit .
The former Louisville team captain wore his championship ring and sat stone - faced as attorneys invoked LeBron James , Louis Brandeis , Muhammad Ali and novelist Nathaniel Hawthornes " The Scarlet Letter " in a bizarre 35-minute prelude .
Lead attorney John Morgan , of personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan , cast the NCAA as an overreaching bully , an organization with no authority to investigate -- or levy punishment for -- criminal actions . "
We are used to fighting Goliath every single day , " Morgan said . "
In the sports world , I do n't think there is any Goliath that exists like the NCAA . "
In a Galt House Hotel ballroom two blocks from where the university was forced to pull a championship banner from the KFC Yum Center rafters , Morgan went on a tirade against the NCAA .
He accused the organization of taking advantage of poor and disadvantaged kids .
He said that the college players should not be called " student - athletes " but rather " student servants . "
In Louisville 's case , Morgan said the players have been falsely accused of being a part of the scandal and want their names cleared .
Hancock said people associate him with strippers and prostitutes even though he was not involved . "
The NCAA has a reputation that I think a lot of people in this room know about .
Like Mr. Morgan said , we 're going to push back , " said Hancock , who was named as the Final Fours most outstanding player in 2013 .
The suit asks for unspecified compensatory damages and damages for loss of economic opportunity and for the NCAA to declare that the players " did not engage in striptease dances , prostitution and tipping of strippers as implied by the Defendant ( NCAA ) . "
It also asks the NCAA to again recognize the plaintiffs for a number of accolades , including the 2013 national championship , Big East ( 2012 and 2013 ) and American Athletic ( 2014 ) conference tournament championships and Hancocks honor as the Final Four 's most outstanding player . "
By God , they re going to do it if we have to drag them down here by the hair from Indianapolis to the courthouse , " said Morgan , referring to the NCAA .
Along with counts including breach of contract and negligence , the suit accuses the NCAA of portraying the plaintiffs in a " false light " - a legal term describing widespread publication of false speech that damages an individual 's mental health and reputation .
The complaint asks for a jury trial if the case does not settle out of court .
The University of Louisville and former head coach Rick Pitino are not named as parties in the suit .
Pitino and the NCAA did not immediately respond to Courier Journal requests seeking comment about the lawsuit . "
We understand the frustrations and empathize with our former student - athletes , " Louisville athletic director Vince Tyra wrote in an email to the Courier Journal . "
These young men expended a great deal of effort and came together as a group to accomplish something very rare and special .
Our university invested significant resources to oppose the vacation of records penalty and engaged the nations top appeals attorney in our defense .
While we were unsuccessful and emphatically do not agree with the decision , we are obligated at this time as a member of the NCAA to abide by the ruling and have complied accordingly . "
Hancock and his former teammates dismissed the notion that they were opposing the NCAA at a five - year reunion June 29 honoring the 2013 team .
Yet Wednesdays announcement brimmed with combative rhetoric . "
One thing a bully understands is blood in his mouth , " Morgan said . "
Were ready to go to battle , " attorney Jon Rabinowitz declared .
Co - counsel Jim Ellis , who played basketball for the Cardinals in the 1970s , said he and Hancock began discussing the idea of suing the NCAA " several months ago . "
Ellis then put Hancock and the other plaintiffs in touch with Morgan & Morgan .
Morgan said his law firm is taking the case on contingency and will only be paid if the plaintiffs win money , and attorneys said they welcome other members of the 2013 team to join the suit .
Of the five players in the suit , only one -- Dieng -- is currently playing in the NBA , with the Minnesota Timberwolves .
This is the second known lawsuit filed against the NCAA in relation to Louisville 's punishment for the escort scandal .
A group of fans , who have dubbed themselves the University of Louisville Protection and Advocacy Coalition , sued the NCAA in April for the reinstatement of the wins and repayment of financial damages .
A judge is expected to rule next month on a motion submitted by the NCAA to dismiss the case .
The NCAA argued that the fan group has " no authority to sue on U of L 's behalf and have not sustained any legally cognizable injury . "
When reached by the Courier Journal on Wednesday , Robert Florio , lawyer for the fans , likened the new lawsuit to the movie " Braveheart . " "
I feel like William Wallace , " Florio joked , referring to the scene where Mel Gibsons character rallied up more Scottish troops to fight the British .
Florio said he heard that the players were getting ready to file their own suit , and he is happy they kept it separate .
While he professed confidence in his own lawsuit , he acknowledged the players have an even stronger claim .
Regardless , he said they have the same goal - to restore the wins and banner . "
They gained a huge ally today , " Florio said . " (
The NCAA ) is going to have a very , very hard time shaking that suit . "

Macy 's executives ring the closing bell at the NYSE in celebration of Independence Day Since 1976 , Macy 's has been hosting the country 's largest Fourth of July fireworks display .
This year , Macy 's executives and guests will kick off with an early celebration on Tuesday and ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange .
Macy 's is warning customers that the retailer discovered a cyber threat that targeted a small number of customer profiles for almost two months .
According to a letter mailed to macys.com and bloomingdales.com customers this week , Macy 's cyber threat alert tools detected suspicious login activities on June 11 .
This " suspicious activity " was being done by a third party , who the retailer said obtained the information from a source other than Macy 's .
From April 26 to June 12 , the third party was using valid usernames and passwords to gain access to the customers ' accounts .
On June 12 , Macy 's blocked the profiles that seemed to be breached by the third party .
Macys.com and bloomingdales.com customers should 've received an email notifying that their profile was blocked .
Those customer accounts will remain blocked until the customer changes the password associated with the profile , according to the letter .
If you did n't receive an email , Macy 's said to check your junk folder for an email with the subject line " Important information about your Macy 's online profile . "
If you ca n't find the email , Macy 's said that your profile still may be blocked and to change the password anyway .
After logging in , the unauthorized party was able to access the customer 's full name , address , phone number , email address , birthday and debit or credit card number with expiration dates .
Macy 's said the macys.com and bloomingdales.com accounts do not include CVV numbers that appear on the backs of credit cards or Social Security numbers .
In the letter , the company said customers should " remain vigilant " for fraud and identity theft .
They also suggested that customers contact their debit or credit card companies to tell them about the data breach .
Macy 's also said it strongly encourages customers to change the password for any online account for which you used the same username and password as your macys.com account .
Because the third party got the information from a source other than Macy 's , that information still could be available .
The retailer also said it arranged to have AllClear ID provide a year of free identity protection to affected customers .

Many Americans have a curious attitude toward Social Security , presuming the program one day will disappear or get significantly scaled back , but not doing much to prepare for it by saving and investing more .
The skepticism about Social Security 's future shows up in one consumer poll after the other .
For example , just 45 percent of current workers say they are very or somewhat confident that Social Security will continue to provide retirement benefits of roughly equal value to benefits currently paid to retirees .
That 's according to the latest Retirement Confidence Survey released in April by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and it was down from a 51 percent confidence reading last year . "
My entire career , I 've had clients tell me they are n't counting on Social Security , " said Dana Anspach , a certified financial planner at Sensible Money LLC in Scottsdale , Arizona .
But eventually , many of these naysayers change their opinions as they reach retirement age with the program still functioning .
In some cases , she added , higher - income clients are pleasantly surprised by how much money they stand to receive , especially if they delay claiming benefits for a few or several years past age 62 , when benefits first can be taken . "
I 've been practicing long enough now that I get to see these clients retire and receive and enjoy the benefits they were so confident they would never see , " Anspach said .

4 key points to consider Social Security pressures loom This is n't to say Social Security 's finances are on firm footing ; they are n't .
The latest report by Social Security 's trustees predicts the program 's current financial cushion or " trust fund " assets will be used up by 2034 .
In or around that year , continuing tax and other income flowing into Social Security would be able to pay for only about 79 percent of scheduled outlays , according to the report .
But as Anspach observed , we have been here before .
She cited legislation passed in 1977 and 1983 that shored up Social Security 's funding for many years , typically through a combination of tax increases and benefit reductions .
Those also are the likely solutions to the looming funding crunch , with Republicans and Democrats differing on how to allocate the pain .
Anspach , who specializes in retirement issues , said she 's " completely confident " another long - term fix can be put in place before 2034 , even though Social Security is n't a high - profile political issue at the moment .
That 's nothing new -- some prior fixes were implemented just months before the program was supposed to become insolvent , meaning it would remain in force but would n't pay all promised obligations .
Benefit cuts possible Even if Congress and the White House fail to enact reforms before 2034 , Social Security would n't go away .
As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget observed in a 2016 commentary , benefits wo n't disappear unless Congress eliminated the program itself , which seems even less likely than mustering the political consensus to firm up funding .
But as noted , the program at that time would be able to pay benefits to the tune of only around 79 cents on the dollar , necessitating cuts of some type -- possibly across the board but perhaps focused on younger or higher - income beneficiaries , or other groups .
A rational person would assume that elected officials eventually will make needed the fixes .
Assuming that 's so , the sooner they act , the better .
Lawmakers should act " sooner rather than later so that a broader range of solutions can be considered and more time will be available to phase in changes while giving the public adequate time to prepare , " the trustees said in this year 's report . "
Earlier action will also help elected officials minimize adverse impacts on vulnerable populations , including lower - income workers and people already dependent on program benefits . "
Pressures entering retirement Meanwhile , many Americans have n't exactly responded to Social Security 's perils by boosting their own retirement preparations .
There has been progress .
As you would expect with the economy humming , jobs are more plentiful and incomes slowly rising .
The latest survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found Americans to be a bit more confident than in years past , with nearly two in three respondents projecting their money will last throughout retirement .
However , the study 's authors also cited factors that suggest many Americans are more confident than they should be .
For example , people still in the workforce expect to remain employed longer than the experience of retirees suggests is likely .
Also , workers tend to underestimate how much they will rely on Social Security , many workers already call debt a significant problem and many currently retired individuals said they underestimated how costly health care would be .
Even without these financial pressures , Social Security benefits by themselves were never designed to fully pay for everything in retirement .
The current average benefit paid by Social Security is a modest $ 1,400 or so a month .
Rather , retirement planning has been envisioned as a three - legged stool , with Social Security representing one leg and workplace 401(k)s / pensions and personal savings the other two .
Personal actions to consider Actions that can be taken to improve personal retirement planning are well known but often neglected .
They include : Increasing your contributions to a workplace 401(k)-style plan if you have access to one .
Opening and socking away money into an Individual Retirement Account , especially if you do n't have a plan at work .
Building up your nonretirement cash reserves so that , to meet unexpected expenses , you would n't need to drain money from a 401(k ) or IRA ( incurring taxes and a possible penalty in the process ) .
Estimating how much money , including health expenditures , you might need in retirement .
Asking for a projection of your Social Security benefits under the My Social Security section of ssa.gov .
Even if the dim projections for Social Security do n't pan out , the program is n't likely to pay high enough benefits to provide a comfortable retirement .
Hence the importance of shoring up those other two legs of the stool .

In fact , bestselling management author and CNBC contributor Suzy Welch says she will " almost always advise people to take a job that fulfills them , over a ' meh ' job that pays well . "
But she tells CNBC Make It there are a few specific times when prioritizing a high salary above all else may be good for your career .
Below , she outlines three circumstances where she says it 's OK to work just for the money .
CNBC Contributor Suzy Welch 1 .
You 're in a deep financial hole If you 're in a position where you 're struggling financially and need more money to make ends meet , then Welch says working at a job simply for the paycheck is understandable . "
I 'm not talking about paying off your student loans , " she says . "
That 's an unfortunate part of life these days . "
Instead , Welch says , she 's referring to what many people may call " do - or - die " circumstances , such as paying back a major debt with a high interest rate or paying off urgent medical bills .
In cases like that , she says , you need to earn as much money as you can and it 's OK to hold onto a job just for the salary .
2 .
You have a strategic plan If you 're working towards a financial goal that requires you to start saving some extra cash now , then working at a job just for the money could be a smart move . "
For instance , " says Welch , " you 're saving for business school or to start your own business .
In those kinds of cases , working for a paycheck is actually a form of investing in your career .
I 'm all for that . "

Marc Saltzman Special for USA Today Did you know more than a quarter of your income is gobbled up by your home ?
Mortgage or rent payments make up the bulk of it , says the Bureau of Labor Statistics , but 11 percent of your annual income goes towards utilities and other household operating costs .
Do nt be surprised : from energy - sucking appliances to leaving the lights on in rooms to blasting your air conditioner all day ( when you re at work ) , it can all really add up .
My wife and I bit the bullet last year and replaced every single light in and outside our home , more than 400 , with LEDs - from pot lights and regular ( A19 ) bulbs to tiny chandelier lights and large front yard flood lights .
Our utility bills dropped by at least 10 % .
This is one of the ways you can reduce energy costs , especially during heavy use times like the summer .
And devices like smart thermostats and power strips can also cut your use and save money .
More : Shocking electric bill ?
Free changes can help you cut costs , save money More : Light up your house with LEDs , and other tips to slash your electric bill LEDs and smart LEDs First , replace your incandescent and florescent bulbs with LED lights , as they sip rather than gulp electricity .
They cost more - so perhaps wait for a big sale or seasonal rebates -- but you ll save money in the long run .
A 60-watt equivalent , for instance , might only need 7 to 8.5 watts for comparable visibility , or lumens , with an LED light , not to mention they can last considerably longer .
Take an A19 EcoSmart - branded LED bulb as an example .
It offers an estimated energy cost of just over a $ 1 per year ( based on a national average ) , which will save you roughly $ 84 over its 15,000-hour lifetime .
A 4-pack of dimmable EcoSmart LED bulbs costs about $ 9 .
More : Solar power is getting cheaper ; here are some smart options for your home Wi - Fi - enabled Smart LED bulbs from companies like Philips and TP - Link cost more , as you would expect , but they can save you even more , thanks to the ability to set schedules and timers , remotely access your lights ( such as turning lights off via an app ) , or , when coupled with room sensors , have the lights go off automatically when you leave the room .
Smart LEDs also let you use your voice to control them ( via Amazon Alexa or Google ) or you can change between millions of colors or preset scenes .
Smart LED bulbs start at about $ 70 for Philips HUE White A19 LED Starter Kit ( 60W equivalent ) , which includes two bulbs and a wireless bridge ( hub ) .
A 50-Watt Smart Wi - Fi LED Bulb from TP - Link costs about $ 20 , but no hub is required as it works directly with your Wi - Fi router .
Smart thermostats Using an app or your voice , programmable thermostats let you conveniently adjust heating and cooling settings - plus some automatically optimize settings based on when you re home and when you re not .
By learning your schedule , sensing occupancy ( with some models ) , and detecting the weather outside , its estimated a smart thermostat could shave off up to a quarter of your annual heating and cooling bills .
Depending on where you live , that could be quite significant .
In other words , unless you have relatives or pets at home , there s no reason why your air conditioning ( in the summer ) or furnace ( in the winter ) needs to be cranked when you re not there .
More : The remote home : there are now many ways to monitor kids and home from afar Even better than Google Nest , in my opinion , is ecobee4 ( $ 249 ) , a smart Wi - Fi thermostat that works with room sensors to help manage hot or cold spots in your home , detecting if someone is there , and delivering the optimal temperature to individual rooms .
You get one sensor in the box , along with the thermostat , but it supports up to 32 sensors .
A two - pack of sensors costs $ 79 .
There s also built - in Amazon Alexa support via its internal speaker and microphone , so you can ask to read you the news , helping plan your commute , set a timer , and , of course , adjust the temperature .
Switches , plugs and strips Ever hear of " vampire power " ?
This is when plugged - in products " suck " electricity , even though they re switched off .
This common ( but little - known ) energy waste is also referred to as " standby " power .
Your smartphone , for example , is probably fully charged after 40-odd minutes , but perhaps you leave it plugged into a wall socket all night ?
This is nt good for your wallet or the environment .
Some products are worse than others , like large appliances and some home theater gear .
The good news is some switches and power strips can completely cut off electricity , on demand , with a button or app , or through a timer .
Belkin , for example , has a line of Conserve - branded switches , sockets and plugs ( from $ 7 ) that shut off all power to whatever is plugged into it - either with the flip of a switch or after a predetermined amount of time .
There are also Conserve power strips for multiple items .
Also from Belkin , WeMo - branded switches and plugs ( from $ 29 ) may not completely cut off power on devices plugged into them , but they let you remotely turn electronics on and off , and manage costs and usage from anywhere , via the WeMo app .
In fact , with the Wi - Fi - enabled WeMo Insight Switch ( $ 34 ) , the app will show you real - time reports on how much energy your devices are consuming ( in dollars and cents ) , plus you can get notifications if your kids are watching TV too long or if your laundry is done .
WeMo devices also pair with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant , so you can use your voice to control it all .
More : Watch out for ' vampire power this Halloween More : More cities require solar as prices fall and sea levels rise Other tips to reducing power - Ensure you 're purchasing consumer electronics branded with the Energy Star logo , as they ve been tested and verified to be more energy efficient .
You should see that familiar sticker on the box and often on the back of the product . -
Curb " idle " time on your devices , such as having your desktop computer or game console go into sleep mode after a short period . -
Wi - Fi - enabled water sensors from Honeywell or D - Link ( from $ 59 ) can alert you if water is detected , say , on a basement floor - even if you re not at home - thanks to the app . -
Doing the laundry ?
Wait until " off - peak " hours , as provided by your electric company , to reduce energy costs .
And run full loads , which will also help cut down your bills .
Wash laundry in cold water to save even more .
Hang dry your laundry . -
While dishwashers use electricity , they save more water ( and thus , money ) than hand - washing , says the California Energy Commission .
Run it during off - peak hours , though . -
Unless its sweltering outside , consider a ceiling fan instead of air conditioning . -
Having good insulation can reduce heating and cooling costs .
Watch out for cracks and holes on or near doors and windows . -
Solar panels can be a great way to augment ( rather than fully replace ) your electricity consumption .
Costs to install them are coming down , too .

March for Our Lives ' is nt a political rally ' More than 1 million people are expected to attend the March for Our Lives in Washington D.C. hoping for changes to gun regulations and school safety .
Mark Cuban once drove around a real hunk of junk -- seriously .
The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner says the best pieces of investing advice he got when young was to be as poor as possible first .
The " Shark Tank " star these days doles out a lot of advice to young entrepreneurs on CNBC CMCSA , -1.80 % , but he says it does nt take a million - dollar idea to become rich .
In fact , Cuban argues , anyone can be a millionaire if they have the right mind - set .
It just takes time and frugality . "
When I was getting started , I used to read this book , ' How to Retire at 35 , " Cuban told Money magazine .
The 1988 tome advised readers to save aggressively in order to gain financial independence . "
The whole premise of the book was that if you could save up $ 1 million and live like a student , you could retire , " Cuban said . "
But you would have to have the discipline of saving .
I believed heavily in that book .
It was a big motivator for me , " he said . "
I did things like having five roommates and living off of macaroni and cheese , and I was very , very frugal .
I had the worst possible car -- those types of things . "
How millennials are disrupting the financial adviser industry Determined Up to age 25 , Cuban says , he did nt drive a car worth more than $ 200 .
He once drove a Fiat X1/9 with , he said , " a hole in the floorboard . "
Another car was a 1966 Buick LeSabre . "
It was crazy .
But that was my decision .
I was determined to save money .
I was determined to be able to retire , " he said .
Life had other plans for Cuban .
He made his first millions in the technology business and has since parlayed that stake into billions .
Scrappy startup founders with stars in their eyes fight to get on " Shark Tank " now , where Cuban and his castmates offer advice and compete to invest in fledgling companies .
Yet , he says , most people do nt have to be entrepreneurs to be financial winners .
In fact , like his fellow billionaire and friend Warren Buffett , Cuban strongly endorses low - cost index funds as a way to build wealth . "
The key is living within your means .
Saving money and putting some into a low - cost mutual fund -- like an SPX SPX , -1.18 % fund -- and living as inexpensively as you possibly can , will pay off dividends , " Cuban says .
Compounding magic By SPX he means an index fund that owns the S&P 500 index of stocks , essentially , a low - cost , diversified way to own the whole U.S. stock market and avoid individual stocks .
Cubans larger point is that saving into a broad stock fund is enough for anyone to retire , thanks to compounding .

Mark Warner and Marco Rubio The Senate Intelligence Committee issued a report last week concurring with the U.S. intelligence communitys unanimous assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a massive influence campaign aimed at the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
The attack included the targeting of election infrastructure , email hacks , weaponized leaks , overt propaganda and a covert , large - scale disinformation effort on social media feeds like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube .
In many ways , this threat is not new .
The Kremlin has been conducting information warfare or " active measures " against the West for decades .
What is new , however , are social media tools with the reach and power to magnify propaganda and false information with a scale and precision that would have been unimaginable back in the days of the Berlin Wall .
The Soviet Politburo could only have dreamed of the capability Russia now has to target voters directly in the U.S. , Europe and other democracies with propaganda , misinformation and disinformation .
Twenty - first century social media tools have the potential to further erode public confidence in western institutions and undermine the shared sense of facts that is supposed to be the foundation of honest political debate .
In 2016 , we were taken by surprise .
In 2018 , there are no excuses .
We must be ready .
Message to Russia as Trump meets Putin That is why we are teaming up with legislators from Canada and Europe to sound the alarm .
Following this weeks NATO summit , parliamentarians from across Europe and North America will meet Monday in Washington , D.C. , the same day President Donald Trump and Putin meet in Helsinki .
Our goal must be to demonstrate to the world that the community of democratic nations does not intend to accede to Putins or any other authoritarians view of the world .
We will resist Russias aggression .
As legislators , we have a responsibility to address that threat -- particularly on social media .
First , as elected officials , we have a duty to use our positions to shine a light on Russias actions and capabilities .
Utilizing our investigative tools and public platforms , legislators must expose the full scale and scope of Russias schemes to weaken democracies .
The two of us are currently engaged in a bipartisan effort in the Senate Intelligence Committee to uncover Russias activities during the 2016 elections and publicly detail its array of asymmetric capabilities .
Similarly , our colleagues in the British Parliament , led by Damian Collins , are conducting an inquiry on " fake news " and how it was used by both foreign and domestic actors to influence the Brexit vote .
But it is not enough simply to shine a bright light on Russian aggression .
As legislators , we also are responsible for crafting and passing laws to protect our democracy while also preserving freedom of expression .
More : Donald Trump is right to question NATO Do n't call it ' meddling . '
The Russians attacked our democracy .
Blame social media for making us more hasty and emotional .
Can we fix this ?
There is little doubt that our own government and our laws have not kept pace with technological change .
The magnitude of this challenge is poised only to expand with improvements in artificial intelligence , machine learning and related advancements like " deep fake " video manipulation .
This technology can literally put words in someones mouth , creating a false narrative that can spread across the globe in minutes .
As our committees work has helped to establish , a key goal of Russian disinformation is to fracture the ability of open societies to reach social and political consensus -- an objective significantly furthered when Americans can no longer believe " their lying eyes . "
If we hope to stay resilient against these threats , were going to need laws that keep up .
The Senate Intelligence Committee has put forward several bipartisan proposals to improve election security and ensure that the intelligence community does a better job of tracking , sharing and responding to efforts by any foreign power to influence our elections , including through social media .
These include making clear to adversaries that we consider attacking our election infrastructure a hostile act and will respond accordingly , and to states that they should replace outdated and vulnerable voting systems as quickly as possible .
As stewards of oversight , we also have a responsibility to ensure our respective governments are ready to track and attack the ongoing threat from influence operations .
In the U.S. , we are not convinced that the national security community is currently organized to adequately rise to this challenge .
Informed public best defense against Russia Finally , we have a responsibility as public officials to raise awareness and ensure that the voting public are fully informed of how our adversaries are trying to manipulate us .
At the end of the day , there is really no better defense against Russian aggression on social media than an informed citizenry -- a voting public that is fully aware of the Kremlins attempts to divide us from within and rejects them .
But social media companies also have a civic responsibility to prevent abuse from proliferating on their platforms and to inform users when they ve been exposed to it .
We in the U.S. have much to learn about Russian tactics from our allies across the Atlantic who have been , and continue to be , on the front lines of Russian information operations .
Putin wants to divide us -- both internally , here at home , and externally , from our transatlantic friends .
Next week , legislators from across the NATO alliance will send him a strong and direct message that it wo nt work .

Marriott International Inc. MAR , -3.43 % said Wednesday that it will remove plastic straws and stirrers at more than 6,500 properties around the world .
The hotel chain joins a list of companies that includes Hyatt Hotels Corp. H , -1.19 % , Starbucks Corp. SBUX , -0.89 % and McDonald 's Corp. MCD , -0.17 % that have also unveiled plans to eliminate plastic straws .
Marriott says the move would end the use of one billion plastic straws and a quarter billion plastic stirrers each year .
The company is also removing plastic straws from its corporate headquarters .
Earlier this year , Marriott began replacing the small plastic toiletry bottles at 450 select - service hotels with in - shower dispensers .
They will be in more than 1,500 hotels in North America by the end of the year .
The efforts are part of a plan to reduce landfill waste and responsibly source its top 10 products by 2025 .
Marriott shares are down nearly 4 % for the year so far while the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % has gained 5.1 % for the period .
MARSHALLTOWN , Iowa -- With the scope of the devastation still sinking in , business owners and residents of the central Iowa city of Marshalltown on Friday began picking up bricks from collapsed buildings , dragging away downed trees and trying to return to the lives they knew before a powerful tornado roared through their community .
Structures throughout Marshalltown were hit by the Thursday afternoon tornado but some of the worst damage was to the historic courthouse and brick buildings that line the city 's quaint town square .
For years , officials and property owners have slowly worked to spruce up the buildings , only to see them devastated in minutes . "
Since 2002 we 've spent $ 50 million in building renovations and now to see these , I 'm just sick , " said Jenny Etter , executive director of the Marshalltown Central Business District , a nonprofit group . "
We were making giant strides in restoring the downtown so this is really devastating to us because we were on a roll .
These buildings were beautiful . "
At the 132-year - old courthouse , a blue tarp flapped over a gaping hole atop the clock tower after the cupola tumbled to the ground .
Local officials promised to rebuild , but some residents were too shocked to make plans .
Crystal Jensen , tears running down her face , said the storm passed in just three minutes , but it left her house in ruins and blew away photos and a bracelet from her father . "
I just lost my dad two months ago and this happened , " she said . "
I 'm kind of at a loss . "
Utility workers repair downed power lines , Friday , July 20 , 2018 , in Marshalltown , Iowa .
Charlie Neibergall / AP Terri Shetler , owner of an embroidery shop on the town square , was digging out her 2017 Toyota Sienna , missing a front quarter panel , windows blown out and filled with mud , shingles and wood slivers . "
I 'm pretty shaken .
I came out and saw the courthouse and all this , " she said . "
But it can be replaced . "
The tornado that hit Marshalltown was among a flurry of unexpected twisters that swept through central Iowa on Thursday , injuring at least 17 people and flattening buildings in three cities .
The National Weather Service said Friday that at least five tornadoes and likely more struck .
Meteorologist Jeff Johnson said it will take days to determine their strength and total number .
Marshalltown , a city of 27,000 , was hit hardest .
Officials said 10 people were injured and at least 28 people were relocated to an emergency shelter .
About 200 workers from several states were scrambling to replace 500 utility poles and restore power to thousands of customers , said Alliant Energy spokesman Justin Foss .
Natural gas service remains shut down in part of the city , he said .
Stephanie Moz said she was in a clothing store downtown with her family when tornado sirens went off .
They took shelter in the building 's basement and heard " booms " and " explosions " as the tornado passed . "
We went through a tornado and survived , " Moz told CBS affiliate KCCI . "
I 'm happy . "
She said the storm broke out a window , ruining clothing on display and destroyed her husband 's car .
The local hospital will be closed for an undetermined period after the building was damaged and 43 patients were taken to nearby communities .
The hospital emergency and urgent care services were moved for now to another building in Marshalltown .
Tornadoes also ripped through the central Iowa cities of Pella and Bondurant , damaging homes and a factory .
Gov. Kim Reynolds toured the cities Friday and then said she 'd signed proclamations that would immediately provide help from state agencies , including providing dump trucks to remove debris and asbestos removal . "
This is the widest area and the most destruction , " she said in Marshalltown . "
Multiple buildings and facilities .
It 's just unbelievable when you take a look at the devastation and destruction that we see . "
In Pella , seven people suffered minor injuries when a tornado hit the agricultural machinery maker Vermeer Manufacturing , scattering huge sheets of metal through a parking lot and leaving one building with a gaping hole .
The National Weather Service confirmed it was an EF3 tornado , with winds about 144 mph .
Several homes were destroyed in Bondurant .
Mattel Inc. is facing a number of headwinds when it reports second - quarter earnings on July 25 , including the Toys ' R Us liquidation .
Mattel MAT , +0.57 % was downgraded twice in June by UBS and D.A. Davidson . "
Mattel has a hard 2Q17 comparison due to the ' Cars 3 channel fill , and with the expected disruption and light shipments caused by the Toys ' R Us liquidation , " D.A. Davidson analysts said .
D.A. Davidson lowered its stock rating to underperform from neutral .
Analysts have a 12-to-18 month price target of $ 12 on the stock , equal to about a 25 % decline from its current level .
How the ad industry is working to move away from the ' Mad Men ' era Read : Half of Amazon shoppers will have an Alexa device when Prime Day is done But Hasbro Inc. HAS , -0.26 % posted better - than - expected results on Monday despite the liquidation .
Second - quarter earnings per share of 48 cents beat the 29-cents FactSet consensus .
And revenue of $ 904.5 million was down from last year , but ahead of the $ 839.3 million FactSet guidance . "
As anticipated , revenues were down in the quarter , reflecting both lower Toys ' R Us revenues and the impact of its liquidation on the marketplace , " said Brian Goldner , Hasbros chief executive on the Monday morning earnings call , according to a FactSet transcript . "
As we said before , we do nt expect to recapture all of the lost revenue in 2018 , but by 2019 we should have moved beyond Toys ' R Us . "
See : Is Netflix falling down a mountain , or just tripping over a molehill ?
Hasbro shares have gained 13.5 % in Monday trading . "
Although the impact of the Toys R Us liquidation and the continued weakness in Europe definitely impacted the quarters results , the impact was less severe than feared , " wrote MKM Partners Eric Handler in a note . "
Heading into the back half of the year , retail inventory levels are down and should be pretty clean . "
MKM rates Hasbro shares neutral with a fair value estimate of $ 92 .
Seventeen FactSet analysts have an average hold rating on Mattel stock and an average target price of $ 16.19 .
Heres what to expect : Earnings : FactSet analysts expect Mattel to report a loss of 30 cents per share after a loss of 14 cents last year .
Estimize , which crowdsources estimates from sell - side and buy - side analysts , hedge - fund managers , executives , academics and others , expects a loss of 36 cents per share .
Also : Where to buy your toys now that Toys ' R Us is gone Revenue : FactSet expects Mattel to revenue of $ 848.0 million , down from $ 974.5 million last year .
Estimize expects revenue of $ 863.4 million .
Stock price : Mattel stock is up 22.3 % for the last three months , and has gained 7.2 % for the year to date .
The S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % is up 5.3 % for 2018 to date .
Other issues : -"Although we believe [ Mattel ] continues to make positive strides with its cost - cutting initiatives we believe the Toys ' R Us liquidation and retailers maintaining tight inventory levels weighed on 2Q performance and is causing us to lower our projections , " MKM analyst Eric Handler wrote in a Mattel note . "
In our view , any meaningful increase in Mattels share price will be a result of an improved top line outlook .
Right now , we believe getting to managements goal of flat revenue for 2018 appears overly optimistic . "
MKM rates Mattel shares neutral with a $ 16 price target . -
D.A. Davidson says Mattels fundamentals have nt improved even though the stock price has rallied , up 16.2 % for the last three months .
Prices for plastic resin , which account for 10 % to 15 % of cost of goods sold ( COGS ) , are also up , which hurt margins in the first quarter .
Do nt miss : Toy makers have decided that what kids should be playing with is poop -UBS agreed that stagnant fundamentals are a challenge for Mattel , but took a more bullish outlook . "
While our fundamental thesis on top - line recovery has taken longer than expected with now added risks of an untested management team and levered balance sheet , we continue to believe Mattel remains owner of the most concentrated evergreen portfolio of toy brands , " analysts wrote .
Mattel announced in April that Ynon Kreiz would replace Margo Georgiadis as chief executive , effective April 26 .
Mattel brands include Barbie , Disney Toy Story and Cars , and Hot Wheels . "
Despite market concerns of secular declines , ( the ) toy industry remains a growth industry , " wrote UBS analysts led by Arpine Kocharyan . "
Because there is no evidence of industry structural declines , we think Mattels market share losses have largely been self - inflicted . "
UBS downgraded Mattel shares from neutral to buy with a price target of $ 18 .
Matthew Wilson USA TODAY It was only a matter of time before Kim Kardashian West 's oldest daughter North West followed in her mother 's footsteps by appearing in an advertising campaign for a fashion house .
Though better known for her controversial reality television series , Kardashian West is deeply entrenched in the world of fashion .
She was even honored as an influencer by the Council of Fashion Designers of America this year .
North , who turned 5 on June 15 , appeared with her mother and grandmother , Kris Jenner , in the second series of an international fashion campaign to celebrate Fendi 's 10th anniversary of their Peekaboo bag .
The three appeared in a video and stills designed to elicit the family bond of three generations of women . "
Starting with @kimkardashian , her mother @krisjenner and daughter North West , who for the first time share a different side of their personalities through a series of candid and spontaneous shots , " read an Instagram post from the Italian label .
The three generations of Kardashian women also starred in a heavily desaturated video that makes the cinematography of " The Handmaid 's Tale " look downright vibrant .
North , dressed in a ruffled shirt , skirt and oversized blazer , can be seen trailing her mom ( sporting thigh - high Fendi logo boots , as one does on hikes ) through tall grass , picking wildflowers and sitting in an open field with Granny Kris before retreating to the pool .
It 's all set to husband Kanye West 's " Love Lockdown . "
On Instagram , Kardashian West wrote , " These @fendi memories I will always cherish shooting this campaign with my mom @krisjenner & daughter . "
Matthew Wilson USA TODAY She may only be 15 , but Makayla Phillips is going to Hollywood .
The Canyon Lake , Calfornia , native wowed judges on NBC 's " America 's Got Talent " Tuesday with her booming vocals in a rendition of Demi Lovato 's " Warrior . "
Strutting across stage , she seemed a natural star reveling in her element that left even judge Simon Cowell impressed .
It was all nerves and hugs before Phillips went on stage .
This was a lifelong dream , her parents said backstage .
The daughter of a firefighter and a drama teacher , Phillips has watched " AGT " since she was 3 and wanted to be on the show ever since .
She honed her singing skills , driving her parents crazy by practicing at even the most inconvenient hour of3 a.m. One of the judges , Heidi Klum , gave Phillips a standing ovation , gushing over the young contestant 's talent .

Klum then pressed the coveted Golden Buzzer , showering Phillips and the stage in confetti .
Introduced in Season 9 , the Golden Buzzer allows each judge to move one contestant straight to the quarterfinals .
The gesture left an overwhelmed Phillips shell - shocked , as her parents and little brother rushed to congratulate her .
Standing onstage beside Phillips like a proud mentor , Klum beamed to her fellow judges , Howie Mandel , Mel B and Cowell : " I think I just found the winner . "

Max Muncy , the Los Angeles Dodgers rookie , is the first player to confirm he will participate in Monday 's Home Run Derby .
Nationals star Bryce Harper , MLB 's ambassador for next week 's All - Star Game in Washington , also plans to participate in the slugging showcase at Nationals Park .
Beyond Muncy and Harper , slots remain open ahead of Wednesday 's lineup announcement .
Yankee sluggers Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge have already stated they wo n't be returning for a rematch .
MVP candidates Mookie Betts of the Boston Red Sox and Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels have said they have no interest .
Who does that leave ?
Here are five players we would like to see join Harper , Muncy in Monday 's showcase : J.D. Martinez , Red Sox - The two - time All - Star slugged his major league - leading 28th home run on Monday to increase his lead over Aaron Judge and Mike Trout by three .
His 28 homers before the break are the third most in Red Sox history , trailing David Ortiz ( 31 in 2006 ) and Carl Yastrzemski ( 29 in 1969 ) .
And if we include his 29 homers he hit with the Arizona Diamondbacks last season , Martinez has 59 over his last 148 games .
Khris Davis , Athletics - Davis does n't get the recognition like his peers , but the outfielder has slugged 106 homers since 2016 , second only to Giancarlo Stanton 's 108 .
With 21 homers at the break , he is on pace for his third consecutive 40-homer season .
Mike Trout , Angels - Why not ?
He s the best player in baseball , and while he 's not obligated to participate , a slew of former MVPs have done so in the past decade .
Stanton , Judge , Harper , Albert Pujols , Kris Bryant , Anthony Rizzo , Josh Donaldson , Manny Machado and Robinson Cano have all jumped into the Derby in recent years .
Getting baseball 's LeBron in it would add immeasurable cachet .
Jose Altuve , Astros - A four - time Silver Slugger , he hit seven homers in the postseason during Houston 's World Series run and 24 each of the past two seasons .
He 'd be the underdog , but would add a relatable element fans would soak up .
Scooter Gennett , Reds - The first - time All - Star has sneaky power and once hit four home runs in a game .
He slugged a career - high 27 in 2017 and is on pace to surpass that mark this season .
May is under pressure from both sides of her party : Strategist Dwyfor Evans of State Street Global Markets says British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming under a " vice - like grip " from both sides of her own party and could face a challenge to her leadership .
Meet the new bundle , same as the old bundle ?
Consumers have embraced broadband - delivered TV from Netflix , Amazon and an abundance of other streaming services , often in search of lower monthly bills - and as a path to avoid paying for channels they did not watch in the big programming bundles sold by cable and satellite TV providers .
But as cord - cutting becomes more popular , a counterintuitive trend is emerging : higher streaming TV prices and bundling , this time among Internet streaming services .
Within the past month , several of the major Internet TV services - Sling TV , DirecTV Now , and PlayStation Vue - have announced price increases .
And providers have started to sell ever larger bundles , some with more than 100 Internet - streamed channels .
What began as a " Great Unbundling " of media is starting to become the " Great Re - Bundling , " says Will Kreth , the executive director of the Entertainment Identifier Registry , a nonprofit group providing a ID system for movie and TV content . "
The temptation to bundle " - to increase revenues from each subscriber from a pricier monthly subscription - " is just too great , " he said .
The live - TV subscriber base is large and growing , with Netflix far in the lead , followed by Sling TV , DirecTV and Hulu .
Just as it 's gaining momentum , prices are inching up .
Sling TV , which in 2015 became the first streaming TV service to deliver a package of live - streamed channels including CNN , ESPN and TNT , recently increased the price of its entry - level Sling Orange package by $ 5 to $ 25 monthly .
It 's also increased its programming bundle to 30 channels from 15 , with the addition of AMC , Comedy Central and others .
Also hiking prices : AT&T 's DirecTV Now streaming service , which has begun charging an additional $ 5 each month for its various programming packages .
The entry - level bundle , with more than 60 channels including local ABC , CBS , Fox and NBC channels in many markets and CNN , ESPN and USA , will now cost $ 40 monthly .
Sony 's PlayStation Vue is raising its monthly prices by $ 5 , starting July 24 , making the cost of its lowest - price plan $ 44.99 for about 50 channels .
The main reason for the price increase ?
The cost of live programming including sports and news , the providers say . "
We must increase the price of our multi - channel plans to keep pace with rising business costs and enable us to continue offering a better way to watch the best in live sports , entertainment , and news , " said Dwayne Benefield , head of PlayStation Vue on the PlayStation Blog .
Earlier this year , other major streaming players unveiled higher prices , too .
FuboTV ( $ 34.99 for first month and $ 44.99 each month after ) in February upped its monthly price by $ 10 for newcomers to its 90-plus channel plan .
Started three years ago as a soccer - centric service , fuboTV now also offers local Fox and NBC channels , as well as news and sports channels .
Similarly , YouTube TV in March raised by $ 5 to $ 40 the monthly cost to new subscribers of its service , which has 50-plus channels including local ABC , CBS , Fox and NBC local in much of the U.S. It added Turner channels such as CNN and TBS at that time .
These prices still fall below the average monthly bill for traditional pay - TV subscribers , which Leichtman Research Group estimates as $ 106 .
But streaming services are tempting subscribers to add more programming .
Should you tack on much more - and add in the cost of Netflix ( $ 10.99 or $ 13.99 monthly ) , and perhaps Amazon Prime Video ( $ 8.99 monthly or as part of a $ 119 annual Amazon Prime subscription ) - your collective bill can quickly approach that of your old pay - TV bill .
For instance , Sling TV has an additional $ 25 Sling Blue package , too , which includes local Fox and NBC channels in many markets among its 40-plus channels .
Subscribers who pay for both Sling Orange and Sling Blue get a discount , paying $ 40 to get both .
And you can add any of nine additional programming packages such as Sports with NBA TV and NHL Network starting at $ 5 each .
The largest DirecTV Now package , which will cost $ 75 with the price increase , has more than 120 channels .
PlayStation Vue 's Ultra plan , due to cost $ 79.99 monthly , has more than 90 channels including HBO and Showtime .
This move to packaging programming is reportedly attracting a prominent name : Apple .
The maker of iPhones and iPads is apparently looking into creating its own bundle , which could include music , video , news and iCloud storage , according to reports recently in The Information and The Wall Street Journal .
Apple did not respond to a request for comment on the reports .
There have been signs that Apple is readying a content expansion .
The tech giant is expected to spend $ 1 billion this year on original content and recently signed Oprah Winfrey to a multi - year content partnership .
Apple last year added a Reese Witherspoon - Jennifer Aniston TV series to its plans .
Bundling video with other content would make sense for Apple , says Mike Vorhaus , president of research and consulting group Magid Advisors .
While they may be behind the other players , " it is far from too late to bring more content packages to the consumer party , " he said .
Streaming prices will likely continue to increase , Vorhaus says , noting that Netflix has experienced solid growth despite a price rise of $ 1 and $ 2 for its standard and premium plans in October .
And consumers can save money via streaming , compared to traditional pay - TV service , he says . "
Even with a skinny bundle and two to three ( streaming ) packages , your pay - TV total cost is likely to go down a bit , " Vorhaus said .
A recent Magid Media Futures survey found three - fourths of U.S. online users pay for at least one streaming video service and the average streaming subscriber has two services .
But rising prices suggest consumers are simply trading the pay - TV cord for the broadband one - a shift that is less costly for providers as they do n't need to provide TV boxes , says Phil Swann , president of TVPredictions.com .
And broadband - delivered TV is not as reliable as cable , satellite or fiber - optic TV , he says .
Prices " will go higher , " Swann said .
Services that include sports are " being forced to raise the price , " says Rich Greenfield , a media and technology analyst with financial services firm BTIG in New York .
That creates opportunities , he says , for services such as the new AT&T WatchTV service and Philo , neither of which have sports networks .
Just about 2 weeks old , AT&T 's new service is free to subscribers of its Unlimited & More data plan ( $ 15 to others ) , and has 30 channels including AMC , CNN and TBS .
Philo 's $ 16 monthly service , launched eight months ago , has 40 channels including A&E , AMC , BET , Comedy Central , Discovery Channel , HGTV and OWN .
So far , consumers seem to be holding firm on their spending , with the average streaming home spending about $ 42 , Leichtman Research estimates . "
The entry price is a little more , " said Bruce Leichtman , president and principal analyst for the Durham , New Hampshire , research firm . "
But we are still in a fairly early stage where consumers are still dabbling with these services and seeing what works for their home .
If the price goes up , it 's part of the trial phase . "

Michael C. Desch Opinion contributor President Donald Trump is ruffling trans - Atlantic feathers once again , this time planning to proceed to Helsinki to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin after meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies , whom he is already needling about their relatively meager financial contribution to their own defense .
Trumps rhetoric , launched even before he took off for Europe on Tuesday , may be undiplomatic , but he is tapping into something real .
Changing American interests and new geopolitical realities are calling into question the future of NATO .
The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis , now known as the March of Dimes , was a nonprofit organization dedicated to the eradication of childhood polio established by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1938 .
By the mid-1950s , childhood polio was almost eradicated .
Rather than declare victory and close up shop , the March of Dimes took on new childhood public health challenges , such as combating birth defects .
The March of Dimes accomplished its original mission and went on to solve other problems .
NATO , created a decade later , also enjoyed success .
Established to " keep the Russians out , the Americans in , and the Germans Down , " by 1989 NATO succeeded as the Iron Curtain fell and the Warsaw Pact collapsed .
Like the March of Dimes , it also sought new missions , such as consolidating East European democracy and keeping peace in the region .
Unlike the March of Dimes , however , NATOs second act after the Cold War has not garnered universal applause .
NATO 's failed second act To understand why , recall that after the fall of the Berlin Wall , East and West debated whether Germany should reunify .
While not fully convinced that it was " three Reichs and you re out , " the reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev understood that reunification was inevitable .
But since Russia and the Soviet Union had borne the brunt of German depredations in the two world wars , he was eager to minimize the danger a reunited Germany might pose down the road .
In discussions with former President George H.W. Bush and Secretary of State James Baker in late 1989 and early 1990 , Gorbachev secured verbal assurances that a reunified Germany would remain in the Cold War alliance but that NATO would not expand beyond the old inter - German border .
Historians debate whether the subsequent retreat of the U.S. from these assurances marked bad faith or simply strategic absent - mindedness .
Either way , for Russians of all political stripes it did not matter , as NATO began to talk about expansion to include states of the former Warsaw Pact and the recently collapsed Soviet Union .
More : Congressional Republicans ' trip to Russia was a shameful fool 's errand Do n't call it ' meddling . '
The Russians attacked our democracy .
Do n't listen to Trump on Russia .
If Group of 7 expands , how about India and Brazil ?
Not coincidentally , the turn of the century witnessed the first wave of NATO expansion and the ebbing of Russian democracy .
In the late 1990s , Boris Yeltsin would appoint a hitherto obscure former KGB Lt .
Col .
as prime minister .
When Yeltsin resigned abruptly in 1999 , Putin succeed him as president of the Russian Federation , a move ratified by an election the next year .
Since then , Putin has tightened his hold on power in the Kremlin through a combination of behind - the - scenes chicanery bolstered by widespread Russian public sentiment that only a strongman could rule Russia and stand up to the West .
Indeed , Putins most brazen acts -- the 2008 war with the former Soviet Republic of Georgia , the 2014 seizure of the Crimea and the ratcheting up of the proxy war in Eastern Ukraine -- came after NATOs 2008 Bucharest Summit , which opened the door for further expansion of NATO to include Georgia and Ukraine .
In late 2013 and early 2014 , the pro - Russian Ukrainian regime of Viktor Yanukovych stepped back from an economic deal with the European Union and violent protests erupted in Kiev -- supported by the U.S. government -- that forced Yanukovych to flee to Russia .
Revisiting this history is important because many Americans have only a hazy understanding of the geopolitical context that helped bring Putin to power -- his recent malfeasance did not come out of the blue .
Global democratic decline The efforts from NATO to remain relevant after victory have not solved new problems , such as spreading democracy in those new states .
Of the 13 new NATO members admitted since the end of the Cold War , 10 have recently seen a decline in their democracy scores from their peak in the period between 1989 and 2017 .
Rather than fully consolidating democracy , NATO expansion played an important role in recreating one of the old problems that it was originally established to combat .
Seemingly a victim of its own success , NATO has gone from playing an important role in winning the Cold War to helping cause a new one .
None of this is to minimize Putins bad behavior in recent years or to dismiss European concerns .
You have to ask , though , how concerned can our wealthy allies be when their average defense spending is well below the agreed to NATO target of two percent of GDP ?
Europe is fully capable of matching -- indeed exceeding -- Russia in almost every category of latent and actual military power .
Given that , perhaps it is time to ask , as Trump is ham - handedly doing , whether Europe and the U.S. might be better served by a different security architecture in Europe that can undertake new security missions without rekindling the Cold War .

Michael King WXIA - TV , Atlanta JEFFERSON , Ga. - Their patient - just off camera - had just suffered a stroke , but three employees of a Georgia assisted living facility made a video of themselves cussing and joking that she s about to die .
Now they re facing possible prison time .
Police say they ignored a critically ill stroke patient who was supposed to be under their care and allegedly took a Snapchat video of that patient , mocking her condition , titling it , " The End . "
She has since died .
Jefferson Police Detective Jay Parker said officers were summoned on June 14 by the executive director of the Bentley Assisted Living at Northminster in Jefferson , about 60 miles northeast of Atlanta .
The director , Cynthia Archer , said that one of her employees had reported the Snapchat video to her and that it had apparently been recorded the night before .
More : A white driver ran over a black man then allegedly sent shockingly racist Snapchat messages The manager said that when she watched the Snapchat video herself , she could identify the three suspects - Mya Moss , Jorden Bruce and Lizeth Ramirez - as they sat in the patient 's room .
At the time the Snapchat video was taking place , the victim had just had a stroke , according to police .
The three employees had been instructed by supervisors to monitor her condition while awaiting a hospice nurse .
On the Snapchat video , Ramirez and Bruce can be seen sitting in chairs laughing , screaming obscenities and using a vape cigarette while Moss was shooting the video . "
They were obviously more interested in playing on the phone and making the video and cutting up and making a joke of the situation , " Parker said .
Instead of playing and making the video , Parker said , the workers should have been paying much closer attention to the patient . "
They should have been watching her , " he said . "
It was my understanding she was having difficulty swallowing , also , with moving around .
She could have choked , fallen off the bed - anything . "
Each of the workers has been charged with exploitation and intimidation of disabled adults , which is a felony under Georgia law that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $ 50,000 .
More : Two men who pleaded guilty to killing dog and posting video of it on Snapchat sentenced to probation Parker said Moss and Bruce were released on bond , however , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has asked that Ramirez not be released at this point .
Parker said he does n't know if the incident had anything to do with the patient 's death . "
Upon learning about this incident , we promptly contacted the Jefferson Police Department and an investigation was started .
No resident 's condition was compromised as a result of this unfortunate event , " the facility 's executive director said in an emailed a statement . "
It is our privilege to be entrusted with the care of the residents of this community and we will never tolerate from our staff anything less than the utmost respect and care for each of our residents . "

Michelle R. Martinelli NASCAR races at Daytona International Speedway are guaranteed to get a little nuts , and Saturday 's Coke Zero Sugar 400 was no exception .
Chaos , overtime , thrilling final laps , a first - time winner and , of course , the big one - the 400-mile race at NASCAR 's second - longest track had a little bit of everything .
And here are our favorite and craziest moments .
1 .
The big one strikes early Daytona is one of two tracks where cars are required to have restrictor plates , limiting their speeds for safety .
But that forces them to drive in packs , so the tiniest mistake can cause a huge disaster .
However , it usually takes a little while for the big one to strike because drivers are purposefully cautious .
Not this time .
Ricky Stenhouse Jr. made contact with Brad Keselowski , sparking a massive crash that involved 26 of the 40-car field .
Seven cars did n't make it to lap 55 , including Keselowski , Denny Hamlin , Kurt Busch and Joey Logano .
2 .
Jimmie Johnson 's stunning survival OK , so the seven - time champ did n't actually make it to the end of the race .
He was caught up in an accident in the final laps and never crossed the finish line .
But his night should have ended a lot sooner , as he easily could have been trapped in the big one .
Focusing on the No .
48 Chevrolet during this gigantic wreck , it 's astonishing Johnson made it out .
He is , however , still winless this season .
3 .
FINALLY a new winner The 2018 NASCAR Cup Series season has been the Kevin Harvick , Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr. show .
Going into Saturday , there had only been six winners through 17 races .
So finally , finally , finally there was a seventh winner in Erik Jones - who took the first career checkered flag in his second Cup Series season .
He also did it in incredible fashion , fighting off Truex - who was his teammate last season with Furniture Row Racing - on the last lap .
Jones only led one lap throughout the whole race , but it 's the only one that mattered .
4 .
Michael McDowell led laps If you 're not a diehard NASCAR fan and thinking , " Who ? "
you 're probably not alone .
McDowell has been racing in the Cup Series for 11 seasons now - he has one top-5 finish - but he 's more likely to be the guy getting criticized for not getting out of the way for the real contenders than being a challenger himself .
But McDowell in the No .
34 Ford led 20 of the Coke Zero Sugar 400 's 168 laps before crashing at the end .
Other surprise drivers at the front included Kasey Kahne with 17 led laps , rookie William Byron with 12 and Ty Dillon with three .
Unfortunately for McDowell , this is what his car looked like by the end of the race .
5 .
Kevin Harvick drove around with someone else 's bumper Yes , you read that right .
With so much bumping and wrecking , drivers are guaranteed to lose parts of their cars - though they usually do n't end up on another one .
But at one point as Harvick pulled down to his pit box , one of the adjustments his team had to make was taking Kyle Larson 's Chevrolet bumper off the front of his No .
4 Ford .
6 .
Rogue tires everywhere With about five laps left before overtime kicked in , Aric Almirola 's No .
10 Ford lost a tire , which helped trigger a crash taking him , plus McDowell and Joey Gase , out of the race .
But as the cars keep going down the track , the tire somehow builds up momentum and manages to bounce off the top of Almirola 's car and actually pass him .
How did this actually happen ? ?
And did NASCAR predict it before the race ?
7 .
Ricky Stenhouse Jr. 's entire night Stenhouse had himself a night , likely irritating - to put it mildly - several drivers out there .
He first triggered the big one by running into the back of Keselowski on lap 54 , and then 10 laps later , he did it again but with Kyle Busch .
Despite creating chaos , not only did Stenhouse manage to stay in the race , but he also won the first two stages .
But later in the race when Kyle Larson lost a tire , Stenhouse made contact with him , but it still was n't enough to knock the No .
17 Ford out of the race .
Then with about 11 laps remaining , Stenhouse lost a rear tire but still returned to the track after hitting up pit road .
And in overtime , he was involved in a nine - car crash .
How he survived all of this to still finish 17th is actually pretty amazing .
And he got a little extra help making sure he safely got back to his bus .
NASCAR has another Saturday race this weekend with the Quaker State 400 at Kentucky Speedway .

Michelle R. Martinelli Somehow , people have yet to learn their lesson about making ridiculous promises or bets on the internet along the lines of : If [ insert crazy thing ] happens , I 'll do [ insert absurd or foolish activity ] .
And , of course , it 's always worse when the promise is a tattoo of some sort .
Enter this guy : Well , bet you can guess what Harry Maguire did in England 's game against Sweden on Saturday .
That 's right - the defender scored in the 30th minute in the World Cup quarterfinal game to help England win , 2 - 0 .
Props to Mr. Benton because he followed through with his misguided internet promise .
The consolation prized for his newly inked soccer fan is his tattoo caught the attention of Maguire , who responded to him on Twitter and offered up an autographed shirt from the England squad .

Michelle R. Martinelli While the MLB All - Star Game rosters are nearly set for next week 's midsummer classic , fans can still vote one more player onto each league 's team .
The Final Vote keeps the door open for one of five National and American League players to still make the roster , and the voting is open until 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday .
The leaderboard was released by MLB on Tuesday , and here 's what it looks like .
Now , we could make arguments for why you should vote for each player based on stats , recent performances , the team they represent , yada , yada , yada .
Or we could help you figure out who to vote for based on respective team 's pitches , which seems like way more fun .
So here goes .
National League 1 .
WWE and dad jokes for Brandon Belt The San Francisco Giants easily win this one with Hunter Pence and Derek Holland 's outrageously hilarious WWE - style performance while they argue for their first baseman to make the All - Star roster .
Plus , we here at For The Win are huge fans of dad jokes , and this one is pretty great .
2 .
Doughnuts and fatheads for Jesus Aguilar The Milwaukee Brewers gave out " Sweet Jesus " doughnuts to fans who voted for Aguilar on Tuesday , and they 've turned this into a true campaign with fatheads , posters , t - shirts and signs for your front lawn reading , " We believe in Jesus " .
But really , you had us at doughnuts .
3 .
Tickets for Trea Turner Several Washington Nationals players have made their pitches for their team 's speedy shortstop , but slugger Bryce Harper has gone as far as bribing fans with All - Star Game tickets .
That 's a pretty tempting offer .
4 .
Magic for Max Muncy If Magic Johnson asks for a favor , how can you say no to him ?
5 .
Baseball things for Matt Carpenter If you want to get all technical about it , this is , in fact , a baseball vote for a spot on a baseball roster .
So I guess baseball highlights work as an argument .
But are they as good as doughnuts ?
American League 1 .
Bennie and the Jets for Andrew Benintendi Boston Red Sox 's Brock Holt has so much love for Benintendi that he became the Final Vote campaign manager .
He 's made internet videos , photobombed a Benintendi interview with a fathead and even changed his walk - up song to Elton John 's Bennie and the Jets .
That 's love .
2 .
Lion King for Andrelton Simmons We are so here for all the Lion King references for the Los Angeles Angels shortstop .
Plus , it led to Mike Trout attempting to sing the opening lines of one of the movie 's most famous songs .
3 .
Roses for Eddie Rosario Cue all The Bachelorette references because that 's how the Minnesota Twins are playing this one .
If you 're a fan of the show and Becca , this is an easy sell .
4 .
Jeans and GIFs for Jean Segura There are so many puns being made about the Seattle Mariners infielder 's first name , and the team is taking advantage .
But we 're also enjoying the jeans on jeans on jeans .
And if this GIF does n't make you love the Seattle Mariners infielder , nothing will .
5 .
No shirts for Giancarlo Stanton The New York Yankees basically just got their players to rally behind Stanton , which is fine , I guess .

Millions of Americans rent because they ca nt afford to buy .
And many of those people struggle to pay the rent , new research suggests , more so if they are African - American or Hispanic .
A renter who earned $ 39,647 per year , the median black household income in the U.S. , could afford just 16.2 % of rentals available on Zillow Z , -2.34 % if they kept their housing costs below 30 % of their pretax income , according to a new analysis from the real - estate company .
Hispanic renters fared somewhat better : Those who earned the median household income could afford 27.3 % of rentals before they risked spending more than a third of their pretax income on housing .
Also see : How ' redlining still hurts home values Spending 30 % of your gross income on rent is the traditional measure of affordability used by many real - estate experts .
Comparatively , white renters who earned the median household income for their demographic could afford 49.7 % of rentals , while Asian renters could afford 67.4 % . "
Perhaps more so than any other factor , income determines where and how we live in the United States today , " said Zillow senior economist Aaron Terrazas in the report . "
Income disparities across racial and ethnic groups in the United States have remained stubbornly persistent and , as a result , black and Hispanic families encounter far fewer affordable rental options than white and Asian families , " he said .
This is what happens when homes are made permanently affordable Matters for black and Hispanic renters were even more dire in some of the countrys largest -- and most expensive -- metropolitan areas .
Black renters in New York could only afford 3.4 % of rentals if they earned the median household income and wanted to keep housing costs below 30 % of their pretax income .
In Los Angeles , only 2.2 % of black renters could afford the rental properties listed on Zillow .
Given the limited options , renters were forced to spend more than 30 % of their pretax income on housing -- and doing so opened up far more options .
If black renters making the national median household income for their demographic spent up to 45 % of their pretax earnings on their housing , they could afford 49.4 % of rentals .
In some cities , like San Francisco , black renters on average had to spend nearly 75 % of their income on rent .
Even in the most affordable rental market in Zillows analysis , the typical rent charged to a black resident required 29.9 % of their median income .

For the overall population , that figure only stands at 47 % .
And research has shown that income inequality faced by people of color makes it difficult to afford housing - related costs , in turn making far more minority households rent - burdened .
And the rising unaffordability of rental properties is increasing homelessness rates across the country .
Paying such a large share of ones income each month toward housing costs can make a sudden change in income much more pronounced , which in turn makes eviction more likely .
MILWAUKEE - A firefighter responding to an explosion caused by a gas line break that rocked downtown Sun Prairie , Wisconsin , on Tuesday night has died , authorities said at an early morning news conference .
The blast leveled several buildings .
Two firefighters were taken to a hospital and one police officer was treated at the scene .
One of the firefighters later died and another is in critical condition .

MILWAUKEE , Wis. -- The state Department of Health Services has reported the first - ever death in Wisconsin from Rocky Mountain spotted fever , a tick - borne disease .
Information has not yet been released about the details surrounding the death of the La Crosse County resident .
Most tick - borne diseases in Wisconsin are transmitted by the black - legged tick , also known as the deer tick , which lives in wooded , brushy areas .
Deer ticks are the infamous transmitters of Lyme disease , which affected 38,000 Wisconsinites between 1980 and 2015 , as well as lesser - known diseases such as anaplasmosis , babesiosis , ehrlichiosis and Powassan virus infection .

A former UFC champion who is coming off the sidelines from a U.S. Anti - Doping Agency violation ( stemming from contaminated supplements ) , Dos Santos is eager to get back to the business he knows best - cracking the skulls of contenders who stand in the way of another title shot .
The man who draws the opportunity to upset the Brazilian is Ivanov , a Bulgarian judoka who is no stranger to scoring upsets against big - name competition .
Starting off on the feet , we have a pairing of two boxing - centric strikers who operate out of different stances .
Dos Santos , who fights out of an orthodox stance , is a crisp boxer through - and - through .
Working behind the pressure of his left - handed feints , Dos Santos will set up devastating overhands and uppercuts , strikes that comprise the majority of the former champions highlight reel .
Though Dos Santos right hand is often known as the cleanup hitter , his left is arguably more accurate , especially when applying his hook .
Often utilizing his hooks offensively off of his jabs and feints , Dos Santos does a deceptively good job of placing check hooks to cover his tracks or drawing his opponents into them through baiting fakes .
Still , countering will probably be a potent two - way street given how these two matchup stylistically .
Ivanov , the southpaw , has shown that he is not scared to throw hands since his days on the combat sambo scene .
A stoutly framed heavyweight , Ivanov does not carry your ideal length by the look of him , but he has a very serviceable game that s helped him garner a respectable record .
Despite being the shorter man , the Bulgarian has demonstrated on multiple occasions that he can play on the outside when he needs to , as well as capitalize on counters when they re there .
Like any good southpaw , Ivanov wields a mean check - right - hook that he attaches nicely to his counter cross .
That said , Ivanov will probably be sticking to his pressure game given what has traditionally worked against Dos Santos - especially if this match goes down in the small cage ( seldom used for smaller venues and shows ) .
Barring his fight with Alistair Overeem , we have seen the element of pressure present Dos Santos with some of his hardest fights , win or lose .
Which is why I suspect Ivanov , who has recently spent time training with Daniel Cormier and Cain Velasquez at American Kickboxing Academy , to try the replicate a similar spirit of game plan against the former heavyweight kingpin .
No stranger to using his strikes to corral opposition toward the cage , Ivanov typically likes getting his shots in with uppercuts to the head and body before transitioning to takedowns .
Although the 31-year - old can hit the trips and tosses associated with his judo base , he can also wrestle well when he calls upon it , executing double - legs that are often chained off single - leg attempts .
But in this contest , however , I believe that the Bulgarian talent will need to empty his toolbox if he means to ground or control the former UFC champion .
Dos Santos , who has consistently held one of the higher takedown defense rates amongst his contemporaries for some time now , wields tremendous defensive fundamentals and hustle that even made the cardio king Velasquez dig deep despite dominating otherwise .
From pushing down on his opponents head to creating separations from the fence , the Brazilian will be no easy task to control .
Should Ivanov get Dos Santos to the mat , we will likely be privy to some surprisingly fast exchanges .
Despite not appearing to have the most explosive frame , Ivanov will jump on a submission if it becomes available in transit , a carryover from his background in Judo and Sambo - sports that have a stricter protocol regarding ground control .
The catch , however , is that Ivanov can subsequently play too loose from topside , often allowing for opponents to stand .
If the 11-year pro fails to find a balance of control , then he will be privy to an underrated grappler in Dos Santos , who is positionally aware and hard to bottleneck into bad spots .
The oddsmakers and public seem to be siding with the former UFC champ while respecting the newcomer , listing Dos Santos -175 and Ivanov +155 as of this writing .
Given that I agree with the line above , its nice to see Ivanov getting some respect in his UFC debut .
The former sambo champ may not stick out on a highlight reel , but he has a strong and rounded base of skills that make him a tough out for anyone in this division .
If Dos Santos ca nt find his groove or is not careful , then he could get sucked into the pressure of Ivanov , especially if this battle takes place in the smaller cage .
Daniel Cormier reminded us this past weekend that some of the best heavyweights carry stout frames , and I could see Ivanov using the pressure and clinch tactics from his recent AKA affiliates to stifle his athletic foe against the fence , possibly even making him pay off the breaks when you consider that Dos Santos traditionally exits with low hands .
In fact , despite my pick , Dos Santos increased reliability on his head movement throughout his career has been a troubling trend .
He may still possess superior athleticism and reaction times than most of his fellow heavyweights , but Dos Santos has leaned on it too much ( needlessly at times ) , causing him to take visible damage in both victories and defeats during the past 5 - 6 years .
Still , I have a hard time picking against him here .
Dos Santos may have hit a rough patch full of inconsistencies , but his noted efforts to better himself at American Top Team - along with the fact that heavyweights have a longer lifespan - lead me to suspect that he is due to return to form .
Even if he is not a new and improved version of himself , I think that Dos Santos game , at its spirit , is a bad stylistic fit for Ivanov .
The difference in cage size is ultimately the question I m wondering heading into this contest .
Though a small cage will probably benefit Ivanov more , I suspect that less square footage will also force Dos Santos to throw with an even higher urgency .
Ivanov has never been stopped by strikes and recovers well , but he also has limited in - fight experience against this level of heavyweight striker , making me believe that Dos Santos may audit the Bulgarians defenses for a building stoppage late into the fight .

Modest gains on Wall Street sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its fifth consecutive advance on Wednesday , as market participants welcomed earnings and measured tone from the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell during his two - day congressional testimony .
Upbeat outlook for the economy from the Fed 's Beige Book also provided support for markets .
The S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % rose 6.10 points , or 0.2 % , to 2,815.65 .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % gained 79.54 points , or 0.3 % , to 25,199.43 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , -1.83 % closed fractionally lower at 7,854.44 .
Among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 , shares of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B , -0.61 % rallied 5.3 % after the conglomerate gave Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett more flexibility on when to buy back shares .
Money is to be made in marijuana stocks in the long run .
But the recent buzz may be overdone .
Canadas Tilray TLRY , -8.40 % has become the first cannabis company to conduct a U.S. IPO .
The shares were priced at $ 17 per share , higher than expectations due to oversubscription .
The stock soared after it started trading Thursday for the first time .
There may be sympathy plays in other cannabis stocks for a short - term trade .
But do nt let your guard down based on sentiment around Tilrays stock .
Markets are not simple when investing for the long term .
Investors need expert guidance .
Not only are investors not getting needed guidance , they are getting burned by supposed gurus .
Read on for the proof .
Lets start with two charts .
Two charts Please click here for an annotated chart of marijuana stock Canopy Growth CGC , -7.19 % .
Please click here for an annotated chart of marijuana stock Neptune Technologies NEPT , -9.94 % .
Please note the following from the charts : * Canopy Growth stock ran up on excitement about the legalization of marijuana in Canada , and many gurus are urging investors to buy this stock as a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity . *
The Arora Report made a negative call on Canopy Growth near the high when most gurus were pounding the table to buy marijuana stocks .
I received some hate mail but nothing like when I gave a signal to sell the gold ETF GLD , +0.40 % and silver ETF SLV , -2.33 % at their highs .
Please see " Investors are making stoner moves by buying marijuana stocks at the wrong time . " *
Neptune Technologies ran up on excitement over a deal with Canopy Growth . *
The chart shows that The Arora Report not only made a negative call , but short - sold Neptune Technologies near the highs . *
Both Canopy Growth and Neptune Technologies have significantly fallen since The Arora Reports negative calls . *
The charts show that the smart money ( professional investors ) was selling near the highs . *
When The Arora Report gives a signal , it almost always simultaneously gives a target zone ahead of time to take profits .
The chart shows that the first target zone for taking profits has already been hit .
Similar price action has occurred in other popular cannabis stocks such as Cronos Group CRON , -7.06 % and Aurora Cannabis US : ACBFF .

Cannabis pharmaceutical stocks The price action is dramatically different in cannabis - related pharmaceutical stocks such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals ZYNE , -4.34 % , Zogenix ZGNX , +8.00 % and GW Pharmaceuticals US : GWPH .
Please see " What to expect from marijuana stocks after the first big medical cannabis win . "
We described to our subscribers the classic " sell the news " reaction in GW Pharmaceuticals stock .
GW Pharmaceuticals is a buyout target .
A buyout can happen north of $ 200 .
The Arora Report subscribers have made a lot of money from buyouts .
To date , 137 of our portfolio companies have been acquired , generating large gains .
This does not mean that GW Pharmaceuticals stock should be bought now .
Prudent investors would want to wait for a buy signal .
Long - term investments There is a long - term opportunity to make a lot of money in marijuana stocks .
However , investors have to be very careful as , currently , valuations are very high and sentiment is very positive .
Often , very positive sentiment is a contrarian signal .
It is best to patiently wait for buy signals .
In the meantime , there are many opportunities outside marijuana stocks .
Examples of where it makes sense for aggressive investors to consider buying on pullbacks are Facebook FB , -4.27 % , Google GOOG , -0.59 % GOOGL , -0.60 % , Apple AAPL , -0.32 % and Amazon AMZN , -1.81 % .

Morgan Stanley MS , +0.46 % handily beat second - quarter earnings and revenue expectations as its brokerage business was booming , but where the bank had a little trouble was with its money management businesses .
Wealth management revenue rose to $ 4.33 billion from $ 4.15 billion in the same period a year ago , but missed the FactSet consensus of $ 4.48 billion , while investment management revenue growth to $ 691 million from $ 665 million shy of expectations of $ 707.9 million .
Within wealth management , transactional revenue fell to $ 691 million from $ 766 million , amid lower fixed income revenue and lower gains on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans , while compensation expense increased to $ 2.4 billion from $ 2.3 billion .
Within investment management , asset management revenue rose to $ 610 million from $ 539 million , but investment revenue fell to $ 55 million from $ 125 million .
Meanwhile , revenue in institutional securities , which includes equities and fixed income sales and trading , rose to $ 5.71 billion from $ 4.76 billion , well above the FactSet consensus of $ 4.60 billion .
The stock , which surged 2.6 % in premarket trade , has lost 7.7 % over the past three months while the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has gained 3.7 % .
Morgan Stanley says the passage of Wells Fargos capital return plan by the Federal Reserve is a significant positive event for the company .
On Thursday , the Fed approved Wells Fargos plan in the second part of its annual bank stress tests .
Earlier this year , the central bank ordered Wells Fargo to cap its assets until it could improve its operational controls amid revelations of sales practice abuses .
Wells Fargo shares rose 3.4 percent on Friday , the day after the stress test announcement .
Morgan Stanley raised its rating to equal weight from underweight for Wells Fargo shares , predicting the Fed will likely lift its asset limit for the bank next year . "
Wells ' Qualitative Pass in the stress test , coupled with 70 % higher capital return approval y / y , eliminates one of our major downside concerns , " analyst Betsy Graseck said in a note to clients on Monday entitled " Positive Stress Test Results Lift Overhang . " "
This also gives us more conviction that asset cap will be lifted by 2Q19 . "
Graseck raised her price target to $ 62 from $ 57 for Wells Fargo shares , representing 12 percent upside to Fridays close .
The analyst said she estimated Wells Fargo had a 50 percent chance to pass the Feds stress test . "
Not only did Wells pass the test , approved buybacks were almost 2x our estimates , " she said . "
This tells us two things that make us more positive on the stock : 1 ) The Fed is receptive of the changes Wells is making to their governance and risk management issues ; 2 ) The Fed is being more pragmatic in its regulatory actions . "
Wells Fargo shares are lagging the market this year .
The stock is down 9 percent through Friday versus the S&P 500s 2 percent gain . --

MOSCOW -- England saw its best chance of ending several generations worth of World Cup pain slip away on Wednesday night , as Croatia fought back for a 2 - 1 win in extra time , securing a spot against France in Sundays final .
England had not been to a semifinal since 1990 , and had not reached the title game since it won soccers greatest prize for the only time back in 1966 .
This , for much of a wild and rugged evening at Luzhniki Stadium , looked like the time .
Until it was nt .
Croatia was one of the most impressive teams of the group stage before surviving two penalty shootouts to reach this point .
Its technical ability and fierce resiliency allowed it to capitalize on Englands nervous lapses when victory was in sight .
Mario Mandzukic got the winner in injury time to put Croatia , with previously a tournament - best semifinal in 1998 to its name , one game away from winning it all .
England made a blistering start , surging into an early lead thanks to a stunning free - kick from Kieran Trippier .
Trippier struck a sweet effort over the Croatia wall in the fifth minute , guiding it perfectly past goalkeeper Danijel Subasic and into the top scorer .
Dele Alli had won the free - kick on the edge of the penalty area , when his powerful forward run was abruptly stopped by a Luka Modric foul .
As the first half progressed , and with England dominant , the opportunity was there to put the game away .
A second goal would likely have done it .
Kane had the best shot at it , finding himself through on goal , firing at Subasic , then knocking a second effort against the post .
But the game opened up in the second half and while England was enjoying plenty of possession it was giving Croatia the kind of space it enjoys .
With 68 minutes gone , things were level .
Ivan Perisic made a strong run in the box and raised his left cleat high to deflect a cross past Jordan Pickford and into the net .
Suddenly , England was rattled and Croatia was resurgent .
Perisic was mightily unlucky not to add to his tally when his angled shot beat Pickford but cannoned off the post .
Croatia had already gone into extra time in the round of 16 and the quarterfinals , prevailing on penalty kicks on both occasions .
England had also won on penalties against Colombia in the second round .
Extra time arrived again and was predictably tense .
Mandzukic had Croatias best chance at the end of the first additional period , but Pickford blocked his shot from close range .
But Mandzukic would not be denied just after the break .
John Stones was slow to pick up Mandzukics run onto a Perisic header , and Pickford was beaten by a left - foot shot that sealed Englands fate and sent Croatia into dreamland .
MOSCOW -- World Cup finalist France has been accused of playing boring , negative " anti - football " following its victory over Belgium in Tuesdays semifinal .
A second - half goal from Samuel Umtiti was enough to keep Frances smooth , if unspectacular , campaign on track , but its opponents were far from impressed at what it perceived as grim tactics . " (
France is ) just an anti - football team , " Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois told Belgian reporters after the 1 - 0 loss . "
I would have preferred to have lost in the quarterfinals to Brazil , at least that was a team that wanted to play football .
France ( headed ) a corner and ( did ) nothing more than defend . "
More : Cristiano Ronaldo 's World Cup punk move backfired on him More : Why the World Cup is a great advertisement for immigration Despite having some of the worlds finest attacking talents at its disposal , France has rarely shown its full potential during the tournament .
In truth , it has been boring at times , with the exception of a scintillating display against Argentina in the round of 16 , where Kylian Mbappe confirmed his reputation as the most exciting young player in world soccer .
Even though the remainder of its performances has sacrificed flair for efficiency , it is still impossible not to be impressed by the way Didier Deschamps side has cruised its way to a spot in the final , without needing to move into top gear .
Soccer purists may not like it .
The French public , hungrily anticipating a second World Cup title and a chance to make up for a home defeat in the final of the 2016 European Championships , does nt care what the rest of the world thinks .
Once Belgium fell behind in the semifinal , even its much - lauded attacking formation could n't find a way through the French defense .
Its players became frustrated , both during the closing stages of the game and afterwards . "
I prefer to lose with this Belgium than to win with this France , " captain Eden Hazard said . "
But they do defend strongly and are very efficient . "
Opponents have found that breaking France down can be a near - impossible task .
Argentina managed to get a foothold thanks to a thunderous goal from Angel di Maria and a fortunate deflection , but falling behind only served to wake the French machine up - including Mbappe .
Frances ability to manage each situation has established it as a strong favorite heading into Sundays final , where it will meet the winner of Wednesdays second semi between England and Croatia .
Since winning the tournament on home soil in 1998 , Les Bleus have suffered different forms of disappointment , crashing out in the group stage in 2002 and 2010 ; losing the final on penalty kicks ( after Zinedine Zidanes infamous headbutt ) in 2006 ; and underperforming in a tame quarterfinal exit to eventual champion Germany four years ago .
With Mbappe emerging as an icon , Antoine Griezmann having blossomed into one of the worlds most effective forwards , and a stacked midfield , there is no team that can match them on pure talent .
Whether the critics consider Frances approach to be smart soccer or anti - football , it is working .
Mosquitos love me .
I m the type of person who walks out to the garden to pick a single tomato , and comes back inside with a trail of swollen and itchy red welts .
On a normal summer day , I m averaging at least a half - dozen bites on all extremities .
I guess I m just that sweet .
There is apparently some truth to the school of thought that mosquitos actually prefer some people over others : " Some people produce more of certain chemicals in their skin .
And a few of those chemicals , like lactic acid , attract mosquitoes , " Dr. Jonathan Day , a medical entomologist and mosquito expert at the University of Florida told TIME .
And according to Smithsonian , mosquitoes landed on people with Type O blood nearly twice as often as those with Type A blood .
Guess who has Type O blood ? !
Heres the real kicker though : I seem to be allergic to most bug spray .
Maybe that s not such a bad thing , considering how many chemicals are in conventional bug sprays , but until I found Aunt Fannies Mosquito Wipes ( $ 9 ) , it made outdoor gatherings quite uncomfortable .
ADVERTISEMENT Credit : Reviewed / Brigitt Earley Aunt Fannie 's Mosquito Wipes , which come in packs of 10 , claim to repel mosquitoes and other biting bugs , like ticks , gnats , and black flies -- without DEET and other harsh chemicals .
The wipes are formulated with just six ingredients , and I m familiar with and can pronounce every single one : peppermint oil , sesame oil , olive oil , castor oil , wheat germ oil , and Vitamin E. Still , they promise to provide up to four hours of protection .
Could these wipes finally get those pesky mosquitos to buzz off ?
I put them to the test during last week on a particularly hot ( upwards of 100 degrees ! )
and humid evening while we were having a backyard barbecue .
Putting Aunt Fannie to the test The first thing I noticed was the smell -- the wipes are minty and fresh .
My brother , who also gave the wipes a try , likened it to a thin mint .
When you apply , it does nt feel like you re putting anything on .
There s no greasy or sticky residue -- just a subtle sheen on your skin , so you know its there .
It was nt particularly hydrating , but it was nt drying either .
I liked that it was neither here nor there , because I promptly forgot I was even wearing bug spray and I did nt have the same urgency to cleanse my skin as I do with normal repellants .
Through the night , people were complaining about the mosquitos and reaching for bug spray -- but I can honestly say that neither my brother nor I were bitten once , despite being outside from 3 p.m. to about 10 p.m. The downside , if there is one , is that there are only 10 wipes per package .
Though one wipe does cover your entire body , there were nt nearly enough packets to offer to the whole party like you could a traditional bottle of bug spray .
All 10 packs were gone in less than 20 minutes and you ca nt share or reuse wipes , so 50 out of 60 people in attendance went without .
Credit : Amazon Even if you were nt having a party , one package would nt be enough for even a family of three for a week .
The cost - conscious would balk at the idea of spending $ 10 per pack when my other favorite bug repellant product , also DEET - free , costs just $ 4 more and is going strong for the second summer in a row .
ADVERTISEMENT Still , I m relishing in the fact that , for the first time in years , I do nt have any bug bites on a summer day .
To me , that s worth the price tag .

On Thursday morning , the Peoples Bank of China set the dollars daily reference rate at 6.7066 yuan , weakening the yuan by 0.2 % .
The central bank allows the currency pair to move as much as 2 % above or below that level onshore , while trading in other financial centers is unrestricted .

Most of us have wasted money on ill - considered purchases or stuff we really could nt afford .
As we get more financially savvy , that happens less often .
But we can still profit from other peoples bad choices .
People who prize the latest and greatest , for example , quickly need to upgrade to the next shiny thing .
That leaves plenty of lightly used cars and electronics for sale at a discount .
People who ca nt look beyond cosmetic damage also provide buying opportunities for those who can , since surface flaws can ding price without hurting functionality .
Then there are the " doh " mistakes : the stuff that did nt fit or turned out to be the wrong shade of robins egg blue .
That stuff gets returned so it can be discounted and snapped up by frugal buyers .
Here are three ways to profit from others mistakes : Buy off - lease cars Low payments can fool people into thinking that leasing is an economical way to afford cars .
In reality , leases ensure you re paying for a vehicles most expensive period -- the first two or three years , when its value drops like a rock .
Vehicles typically lose about 30 % of their value the first year , and a total of 40 % by the third year , says Ivan Drury , senior manager of industry analysis for car comparison site Edmunds.com .
The good news for bargain hunters : A whole lot of people have made that pricey choice in recent years , leading to a record 4 million vehicles coming off their leases this year .
In addition to discounts of 30 % or more compared with a new car , buyers will have plenty of options .
Leasing was once mostly limited to luxury cars , but its grown so popular that buyers have plenty of used makes and models to choose from .
That includes the " it " vehicle of the moment : compact SUVs , Drury says .
These freshly off - lease vehicles tend to have midrange trim packages , which means they re not bare bones but they re also not overloaded with features you might not want to pay extra to have , Drury says .
They will have the kinds of safety features and technology that a few years ago were only available in luxury cars . "
They have backup cameras , Bluetooth , blind - spot detectors , " Drury says . "
You can get a lot , at greatly reduced prices . "
Look for truly refurbished electronics Thrifty shoppers tend to stay a generation or two behind on electronics , knowing that early adopters pay a hefty premium .
But within a few weeks of virtually any gadgets debut , there will be buyers regretting their purchases and companies refurbishing those returns for resale .
Depending on the seller , though , " refurbished " can mean " like new , " with fresh batteries , new cases , and one - year warranties -- or not . "
Some just say ' refurbished because they wiped it down with a rag , " says Tercius Bufete , associate editor for Consumer Reports .
The electronic item may come with third - party accessories , such as charging cords , or none at all .
The only way to know is to " read the assurances , " Bufete says .
That s the fine print that spells out what s been done to the item , the warranty ( if any ) and the length of the return period ( if any ) .
Just in case , consider using a credit card that offers " return protection " or " guaranteed returns . "
This benefit offers you money back , up to certain limits , if a merchant refuses to accept a return .
Check the ' open box section The phrases " open box " and " scratch and dent " are music to the bargain hunters ears .
They signify new or nearly new items at a discount -- sometimes a steep one .
Bargain shoppers at IKEA , for example , know to cruise the stores " as is " section for deals on already - assembled furniture and other items returned by customers who changed their minds .
Likewise , big - box home improvement stores usually have an " open box " area for returns and floor models . "
Scratch and dent " stores are another option for picking up someone elses oopsie , whether its a homeowner who forgot to measure an appliance or a piece of furniture that got dropped during delivery .
Its important to check warranties and return policies .
Sears US : SHLD Outlet , for example , has a 30-day return policy for most purchases , but not floor models .
Other stores make all their scratch - and - dent sales final .
More from NerdWallet :
Most people think they re above average in intelligence , relationship status and professional achievement .
Social scientists call this " illusory superiority . "
My business partner Scott Puritz , has found the one area where even above - average people , objectively smart , rich , successful professionals , seem to wave the white flag and admit to not understanding -- money and investing . "
One of the most shocking things is the low - level financial literacy throughout our culture , " Puritz told the Washington Post . "
Its independent of education .
Doctors , MBAs , corporate executives are incredibly competent in everything they do .
But when it comes to investing , you run into this cauldron of mostly negative emotions , embarrassment , frustration , guilt .
It leads to paralysis . "
Sound like you ?
If so , do nt worry .
You re not alone .
Two - thirds of Americans ca nt pass a five - question financial literacy test , according to FINRA , the industry - run regulator that oversees stockbrokers .
And that s because the fundamentals of finance are boring , and aggressively so .
To understand it you need to grasp the interplay of money and time , and that s just hard for humans to do .
Both money and time are abstractions .
Figuring out how they relate is a real challenge .
As Scott explains , the outcome is that even people with advanced degrees and professional success can fail at building a nest egg .
And they fail , interestingly , in two distinct ways .
Street education One group tells themselves that they do nt understand money and delegates the responsibility to a professional .
They get " a money guy " who seems to be capable of investing their savings and just forget about it for a few decades .
A second group does get a bit more educated , but its largely a street education .
They open a trading account , plunk down a few thousand bucks and start hunting for stock tips .
Maybe the neophyte trader makes a bit of money or maybe he loses a bit , but he usually gets bit by the market bug and stays with it , buying and selling on his own with no help at all .
Both approaches are extremely risky , for different reasons .
The first group , by abdicating responsibility for their own money , can fall victim to scams .
It happens all the time .
Often , though , they get reasonably good investment help but pay tremendously high fees for what turns out to be average long - term returns .
The fees , of course , absolutely devour those returns .
The typical investor pays 1 % for investment advice and another 1 % in fees for mutual funds bought in their name .
The result : One - third and up to one - half of investor gains is absorbed by fees .
The " money guys " take zero risk ( its not their money , its yours ) but nevertheless get a huge reward .
The second group , the emboldened traders , also can fall victim to scams .
Penny stocks , illiquid investments , and highly leveraged strategies are just a few examples .
Mostly , though , amateur traders fall victim to the DALBAR effect , named for the market research firm that tracks how dramatically individual investors underperform the stock market over time .
This happens because the small investor thinks he knows what he s doing .
So there s lots of buying and selling .
Sweet spot The extra effort rarely pays off .
Over the 20 years ending in 2017 the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % -- the broad index of large U.S. stocks -- returned 7.2 % a year .
That return is on track to double a nest egg every 10 years .
In contrast , DALBAR finds , the average individual investor saw a return of just 2.6 % .
At that rate , it takes 30 years to double the balance in an investment account .
Given the risks , what do smart rich people actually do ?
The key is to lower your costs , be consistent in your investment process , and of course to save enough to build a nest egg in the first place .
If you can manage that , there s a solid middle ground between doing nothing and doing too much .
The sweet spot is what we call " portfolio indexing , " a form of low - cost portfolio management that harnesses the stock markets propensity to rise over time and lets compounding do its magic .
The final piece of the puzzle is to avoid emotional risk , the chance that you ll end up selling when stocks fall .
For many people , having a conflict - free financial adviser is the solution . "
Our front - line people are financial therapists , " Scott told the Post . "
They need to be empathetic .
People are very emotional about their money . "
Indeed they are .
But there is an answer , which is educating yourself on how risk - adjusted investing works in the real world .
After a while , you will make peace with the process and grow to accept that an even keel makes for smooth sailing , no matter which ways the market winds blow .
Musk said the aluminum shell of the so - called submarine had high thermal conductivity , meaning it is able to allow heat to pass through it with ease , and therefore provide insulation to the person inside .
The vessels structure was made from the liquid oxygen transfer tube of a Falcon rocket , manufactured by Musks space exploration business SpaceX. The Tesla chief executive on Sunday shared a video via Twitter , demonstrating a " tiny , kid - size submarine " being used to transport a person across a pool .
The submarine weighs 40 kilograms when dry , and Musk even raised the possibility of creating a compartment to add a music player to soothe the anxiety of the boys traveling in it .
Rescuers have ramped up efforts to save the boys and their soccer coach , who were discovered trapped inside the flooded Tham Luang cave in the Chiang Rai province last week .
Officials had feared huge delays to the operation due to expected heavy rainfall that would have contributed to further flooding .
A diver who had served in the Thai navy died last week from a lack of oxygen after delivering air tanks to aid the rescue mission .
So far , four boys out of the 12 trapped are confirmed to have been rescued from the cave .
The rescue efforts resumed Monday following a 10-hour pause that was called last night to replenish scuba tanks with oxygen .
A fifth boy has been rescued too , according to multiple reports Monday .
Musk said it would take 17 hours to deliver the mini - submarine . "
Hopefully , ( it will be ) useful , " he said on Twitter . "
If not , perhaps it will be in a future situation . "
On Saturday , he sent engineers from two of his companies , SpaceX and tunneling firm The Boring Company , to examine the situation and see if there was anything they could do to help .
Musk raised the possibility of pumping water through the cave to enable a safe exit and of inserting a nylon tube into the cave to inflate it with air " like a bouncy castle . "
The proposed submarine is the latest in a long line of the entrepreneurs wacky ideas and promises .
He has put his name behind everything from and to building the .

MyLoupe | Getty Images Retirees hoping to spend their golden years in an idyllic retirement community should slow down before signing over their savings .
Continuing care retirement communities , or CCRCs , give retirees the opportunity to age in one location , moving from independent living to assisted living and eventually skilled nursing care .
The arrangements are convenient and often luxurious , but some older Americans may overlook the financial due diligence they need to undertake before committing to a facility .
Often retirees may shell out well over $ 100,000 as an initial deposit and signing on for additional monthly payments that may change over time as their need for care increases .
Walk through the memory care and nursing care areas and talk to people .
Look at the staffing .
Are people getting help from the staff ?
Are the residents happy and cared for ?
Gregory Zebolsky principal , consulting actuary , Milliman " For many people , even though this is the largest purchase in their lives and they put in a good chunk of their retirement savings , many are penny wise and pound foolish , " said Bernard Krooks , an elder law attorney and founding partner of Littman Krooks in New York City .
One of his clients paid $ 2 million up front to reside in a continuing care community .
That retirees family is supposed to receive 90 percent of the deposit if he moves out or dies there , regardless of how long he resides there .
This refund policy will vary from one facility to other . "
They wo nt hesitate to write a six- or seven - figure check to the facility , but its a bigger hurdle to have an accountant or advisor review the balance sheets , " Krooks said .
As of the end of 2017 , there were 1,955 such communities in the U.S. , according to Ziegler , an investment bank .
Heres what you should know before you decide to live in one .
Amenities Dougal Waters | Getty Images Narrowing down the continuing care center you re interested in will begin with a question of lifestyle : You re opting to spend the rest of your life there . "
You re talking about everything from the floor plans , to the meal plans , services and amenities , " said Brad Breeding , a certified financial planner and founder of myLifeSite , a retirement community research site .
High - demand amenities include fitness centers on site and multiple dining venues , including cafes and bistros , said Gregory Zebolsky , principal and consulting actuary at Milliman .
Though the independent living facilities are the show stoppers , you should also check out their assisted living and nursing care departments before deciding . "
Walk through the memory care and nursing care areas and talk to people : Look at the staffing , " Zebolsky said . "
Are people getting help from the staff ?
Are the residents happy and cared for ? "
Dig into the books Another reason to look closely at your continuing care center : If its independent living quarters are sparsely occupied , there might be financial troubles ahead . "
In some cases , lower than 90 percent occupancy could suggest an issue with being able to fill certain units with new residents , and the inability to maintain a high occupancy level could be an indicator of problems in the future , " said Zebolsky .
Get into the details and work through them with your accountant : Key financial reports to obtain from your continuing care center include its audited financial statements , data on monthly service fee increases , financial ratios and reserves , according to the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform .
Further , when continuing care centers do run into financial difficulty , there is no guarantee that a resident will get his or her money back .
In that case , another provider may buy out a struggling facility , potentially leading to a change in services and fees , Breeding said .
Review your state 's rules CCRCs are regulated by the states in which they are based .
The degree to which those regulators will scrutinize these communities will vary .
For instance , some states require that these communities have their resident contracts approved by regulators and that their policies must address how and why monthly fees may increase , according to a 2010 report from the Government Accountability Office .
Prospective residents should reach out to the agency that oversees CCRCs within that state , said Breeding .
Here 's a list of state agencies that regulate these retirement communities .

NASCARs latest race of the season kicks off at Daytona International Speedway on Saturday .
The Coke Zero Sugar 400 is a key event for drivers looking to make it into the playoffs .
The famed track is also home to the sports annual season opener : the Daytona 500 .
But interest in the sports signature race appears to be waning .
This February , the event drew a Nielsen Rating of 5.3 , a record low for NASCAR , according to Sports Media Watch .
Some say it is just the latest sign the sport is losing its core fan base .
For more than 70 years , NASCAR has been a staple in American sports .
It got its humble start hosting races on the beaches of Daytona , Florida , and has since grown into America 's premier auto racing league .
But the iconic U.S. sport has had an undeniably rough few years .
It has been losing TV viewers .
It is having trouble filling the stands , even after losing tens of thousands of seats from its stadiums .
Perhaps most worrisome of all , it is losing sponsors , and those that remain are paying less than they used to .
NASCAR declined a request for comment .
So what went so wrong for NASCAR ?
Straying from the brand It is partly to do with the fact that it 's alienated its core stock car racing fan .
In a bid to attract a new kind of audience , NASCAR moved into trendier markets in the ' 90s .
NASCAR built superspeedways in Las Vegas and Southern California - and shut down some classic venues in America 's southern states .
The move to be nimble with the brand backfired .
The new crowds did n't convert into the die - hard loyalists that the sport needed .
Former NASCAR executive Ramsey Poston says the league was trying to enter new markets without the Southern stigma -- a move that he calls a mistake . "
NASCAR seems to have run away from its Southern roots .
In doing that , it 's damaged its brand identity .
For example , a brand like Jack Daniels .
It has an outlaw connotation to it .
It 's clearly from the South and never has Jack Daniels apologized for it . "
NASCAR also tinkered with its race format multiple times over the years .
And then there was that infamous car redesign in 2007 .
The " Car of Tomorrow " was a lot less noisy - and safer .
But less high - speed pileups and more single - file racing did n't play well with fans .
It also streamlined the look of rival cars , again subduing fan fervor .
Sponsor apathy All that , together with the Great Recession - and the rise of cord cutting - has taken its toll on NASCAR .
Spectators and more worryingly , sponsors , have jumped ship .
Target ended 16 years of NASCAR sponsorship in 2017 .
Sponsorships have always been the lifeblood of NASCAR and a prominent part of its image - as seen on its cars and driver racing jackets .
Jerry Freeze , general manager of Front Row Motors , says the " overwhelming majority " of its income comes from sponsors .
Though the breakdown varies from team to team , Freeze says it can comprise as much of 75 percent of its revenue .
At one point , it attracted more money from more Fortune 500 companies than any other sports or entertainment property in the U.S. AP reports that at its peak , a top team might spend $ 30 million to run a race car - with sponsorship money funding most of that .
But now , some owners say they 're getting half of what they used to 15 years ago .
Freeze says it 's become more challenging over the years to land sponsorships . "
The beginning of my time in NASCAR , we would have one sponsor that would sponsor the car for the whole year .
And now the car has a different look each week , depending on who the partners are .
So you 're left scrambling to get decals produced and putting them on the car before the next race . "
NASCAR teams are n't just losing sponsors , they 're also slashing the going rate to advertise .
France family considers jumping ship NASCAR is notoriously closed - mouth about its earnings , making it difficult to gauge the financial fallout of NASCAR 's fading popularity .
The league has been privately owned by the France family since its start .
Despite rumors it was looking to ditch its majority stake , Forbes is reporting the family is only looking to bring in minority partners , citing sources familiar with the matter inside the league .
Nobody knows exactly how much NASCAR is worth , but if the international racing league Formula One is any indicator , we are looking at something in the multibillion - dollar range .
F1 sold for $ 8 billion in 2016 .
NASCAR still rakes in lots of TV dollars

Natalie Alund and Souichi Terada Nashville Tennessean At least 20 people have been transported to nearby hospitals and at least 200 have been treated for heat - related illnesses at the Warped Tour concert at the Nashville Fairgrounds , authorities said .
According to Nashville Fire Department spokesman Joseph Pleasant , the 20 victims were taken by fire crews and Vanderbilt University Medical Center paramedics on Tuesday . "
We anticipate more as the first aid tent continues to stay full , " Pleasant said .
Vanderbilt LifeFlight public information officer Jerry Jones said under five of the 20 victims went to children 's hospitals .
By 2:30 p.m. , relief came in the form of scattered showers .
Some attendees fled to the Fairgrounds Speedway 's covered bleachers for shelter , while others soaked up the rain as the music continued .
The 2018 tour marks the 24th and final annual installment of the traveling punk rock festival , which has also served as a launching pad for massive acts including Eminem and Katy Perry .
Throughout its run , Warped has attracted a notably young audience : as of 2015 , 92 percent of the crowd was between the ages of 15 and 25 .
Jones said most of the people treated were young adults who were n't prepared for the heat .
The tour was expected to draw 15,000 people to the fairgrounds .
The gates opened at 11 a.m. Tuesday and , according to the tour 's website , at least 60 bands were expected to perform .
According to the National Weather Service in Nashville , the high temperature for the day reached 92 degrees Tuesday .
The heat index is expected to climb to the upper-90s .
In a tweet , the Nation Weather Service said " Although it 's technically not as hot and humid as it was last week ( currently a heat index of 97 degrees versus 109 degrees on July 4 ) , it 's still plenty hot out there .
If you 're outdoors for long periods of time , remember to stay hydrated and take frequent breaks in the shade or A / C ! "
Meteorologist Matt Reagan had tips to avoid any heat - related illnesses for those attending the concert .
He said to stay hydrated , avoid the heat of the day and to avoid any alcohol consumption .

The Domestic Streaming segment derives revenues from monthly membership fees for services consisting of streaming content to its members in the United States .
The International Streaming segment includes fees from members outside the United States .
The Domestic DVD segment covers revenues from services consisting of DVD - by - mail .
The company was founded by Marc Randolph and Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr. on August 29 , 1997 and is headquartered in Los Gatos , CA .
Netflix Inc. posted weaker - than - expected second - quarter subscriber numbers and revenue Monday afternoon , sending its stock into a sharp dive during after - hours trading .
Netflix shares NFLX , -3.76 % traded 12 % lower in premarket action Tuesday after the Los Gatos , Calif.-based company announced it added 5.15 million streaming users in the second quarter , a substantial drop from the 6.2 million estimate the company provided in April .
The company added 4.47 million international subscribers and 670,000 domestic subscribers , missing its April estimates of 5.9 million and 1.2 million .

The company reported a profit of $ 384 million , or 85 cents a share , topping the FactSet consensus of 79 cents a share and up from $ 66 million , or 15 cents a share , in the same quarter a year ago .
Revenue rose to $ 3.91 billion from $ 2.79 billion the year before , just below the FactSet consensus of $ 3.94 billion .
In a letter to shareholders , Netflix said the company had a " strong but not stellar " quarter , acknowledging the company had " over - forecasted " both domestic and global net subscriber additions and " acquisition growth was lower than we projected . " "
We ve seen this movie of Q2 shortfall before , about two years ago in 2016 , and we never did find the explanation to that , other than there is some bumpiness in the business , and continued to perform after that , " Chief Executive Reed Hastings said during Netflixs version of an earnings conference call , a prerecorded interview with a single analyst who asks questions .
The analyst on Mondays earnings call was Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.s Todd Juenger .

In uber growth stories , especially in technology , from Apple to Amazon to Netflix , you re going to run into these one- or two - quarter issues when they re white - knuckle periods in the very near - term . "
In its letter to shareholders , Netflix blamed the strengthening of the U.S. dollar for its weaker - than - expected international revenue .
In April , the company predicted a $ 65 million - plus impact on international revenue year over year , but the impact turned out to be smaller due to the strengthening of the dollar against many international currencies , the company said .
Netflix does not hedge its revenue with derivatives . "
We slowly adjust pricing over time to mitigate forex moves over the longer term , but when currency movements are rapid , they will affect our near term operating margin , " Netflix wrote . "
Well tend to outperform our near term operating margin targets on dollar weakness and underperform on dollar strength . "
In its letter , Netflix acknowledged rising competition from other entertainment companies . "
HBO and Disney DIS , -1.90 % are evolving to focus on internet entertainment services .
Amazon AMZN , -1.81 % and Apple AAPL , -0.32 % are investing in content as part of larger ecosystem subscriptions , " Netflix wrote . "
We anticipate more competition from the combined AT&T / Warner Media , from the combined Fox / Disney or Fox / Comcast as well as from international players like Germanys ProSieben and Salto in France . "
The company reiterated its commitment to a broad slate of content " to serve a wide variety of tastes , " citing its second - quarter debut of sci - fi action series " Lost in Space , " which was renewed for another season , and the release of the second season of " 13 Reasons Why . "
Other second - quarter offerings included follow - up seasons of " Santa Clarita Diet , " " A Series of Unfortunate Events , " " Marvels Jessica Jones , " La Casa de Papel , " " GLOW , " and " Marvels Luke Cage . "
Netflix also debuted several romantic comedies like " Set It Up " and " The Kissing Booth , " both of which were " watched and loved by tens of millions of Netflix members , " according to the company .
In the earnings interview , Hastings said Netflix does not have any plans to move into new genres like sports , news , gaming or audio content .
Movies and TV are " consuming every bit of energy and excitement we have , " he said .
See also : Stock gains in 2018 are nt just a tech story , but they re mostly a tech story The streaming giant also doubled down on international content in the second quarter , releasing the second season of " 3 % , " a sci - fi thriller from Brazil , as well as the Indian original film " Lust Stories " and Danish thriller " The Rain , " which the company said became one of its " biggest non - English original productions yet , with viewing all over the world . "
Some viewers and analysts have wondered if Netflixs rate of content output will mean a decrease in quality of its shows and movies .
But for now , critics seem to approve of the companys offerings , as Netflix last week nabbed the most Emmy nominations of any network , breaking HBOs 17-year streak of leading TV networks in nominations .
The company is focusing heavily on marketing amid the content push , spending $ 576.7 million this past quarter and just more than $ 1 billion in the past six months .
As for how that s allocated , " only a fraction of our spend is oriented around direct acquisition , " said Netflix chief financial officer David Wells during the companys earnings interview . "
The majority of the marketing spend -- call it 80 % to 85 % -- is oriented around building title brands . "
Netflix also ramped up its spending on technology and development , spending $ 317.2 million in the second quarter .
Last week , the company unveiled " Smart Downloads , " a feature aimed at users who download episodes to watch on phones or tablets while on the go .
The feature deletes an episode after a user watches it , and then automatically downloads the next episode while the device is connected to Wi - Fi .

During the second quarter , the company burned $ 559 million more than it brought in , 8.8 % less than the same quarter last year , when it burned $ 608 million .
Netflix said it continues to anticipate negative free cash flows of $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion for 2018 , implying its content cash spending will be weighted to the second half of 2018 .
Netflix completed its latest bond deal , raising $ 1.9 billion , in the second quarter , and its gross debt balance now stands at $ 8.4 billion . "
We continue to see debt as the most optimal choice , the most cost - effective source of capital for the company , " said Wells . "

But until we do , we see as debt as the right choice in terms of cost of capital , " he said .

NEW YORK - Take it from Elsie Fisher : The movie " Eighth Grade " is a lot like the real thing .
The young actress started shooting the film a week after graduating from middle school , making the ups and downs her insecure character , Kayla Day , endures during her last week of junior high all too relatable . "
Kaylas experience is not actually autobiographical for me , but emotionally it is , " Fisher says . "
It all felt very real .
A lot of movies for kids by adults feel disingenuous . " "
Eighth Grade " ( in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles , expanding nationwide throughout the summer ) is written and directed by stand - up comedian Bo Burnham , who wanted to capture what it 's like to grow up in the social - media age .

Burnham , 27 , and Fisher , 15 , break down some of the film 's most authentic and cringe - worthy aspects .
Elsie Fisher was really shy at her audition .
Kayla appears in virtually every frame of the film , as she anxiously navigates trying to talk to boys , make friends and keep the eye rolls to a minimum when her awkward but well - meaning dad ( Josh Hamilton ) attempts to have a conversation with her .
More than 50 girls auditioned for the role , but Burnham was immediately drawn to Fisher , who previously voiced youngest child Agnes in the " Despicable Me " movies . "
She was the only one who felt like a shy kid pretending to be confident - everyone else felt like a confident kid pretending to be shy , " Burnham says . "

One of the most strikingly relatable aspects of the film is Kayla 's acne , which glistens in the light from her laptop screen as she diligently watches makeup tutorials on YouTube .
Burnham did n't attempt to either accentuate or cover up Fisher 's real pimples during the shoot : " That 's just how I am , " says Fisher , whose skin has since cleared up .
Adds Burnham : " Yeah , we were just like , ' Whatever - it 's what kids have . ' "
Those are actual middle - schoolers and teachers onscreen .
The film was shot on location at Suffern Middle School in Suffern , New York , using actual students and teachers as extras . "
We got the school to leave up all their stuff - the art in the hallway was made by kids during that year , " Burnham says .
Kayla 's " band teacher with the rat tail ( haircut ) was the school 's band teacher .
That scene was n't even in the movie , but we scouted the ( location ) , he showed me his tubas , I saw his rat tail and was like , ' You 're in the movie . ' "
Burnham watched YouTubers to learn how Gen Z talks .
Kayla often records exuberant self - help videos for her little - followed YouTube channel , covering topics such as how to be more confident and put yourself out there .
Writing the film , Burnham dug deep into YouTube to transcribe and study actual advice videos by middle - schoolers , inserting " ums , " " likes " and pauses into the script . "
I was just trying to capture the staccato way they spoke , " he says . "
You re watching someone try to articulate themselves and think out loud while their brains are still growing . "
He also got some input from Fisher , who had her own short - lived YouTube channel dedicated to the video game " Minecraft " back in sixth grade . "
There 's still videos up on there , " she says . "
It 's bad . "
All of the Instagram accounts in the movie are real .
For the many scenes of a glassy - eyed Kayla scrolling through her phone , Burnham was adamant about shooting her actual phone screen in real time .
That meant the production team was tasked with creating dozens of Instagram accounts for Kayla and her classmates : uploading and " liking " posts for each one , and standing off - camera to send texts and direct messages whenever Kayla was corresponding with them . "
Her interacting with the actual internet changes the scenes , emotionally and visually , " Burnham says . "
I hate ( in movies ) when someone tweets and it just shows up in a bubble on screen .
That feels so not real . "
NEW YORK -- Fox News says host Kimberly Guilfoyle is leaving the network , amid reports that she 's about to take on a new role with a super PAC supporting President Trump 's agenda .
Guilfoyle has been one of the co - hosts of the network 's afternoon show " The Five " and has been dating President Trump 's son Donald Jr. A Fox spokeswoman confirmed her departure Friday .
She was considered for White House press secretary last year after Sean Spicer departed the administration .
A person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to speak publicly about them said Guilfoyle will be joining America First PAC , which has been promoting Trump 's record .
Guilfoyle , a former prosecutor , was married for four years to California Lt .
Gov. Gavin Newsom .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 's office on Monday unveiled an investigation into whether Kushner Cos . ,
the real - estate firm owned by the family of President Donald Trump 's son - in - law and adviser Jared Kushner , violated housing laws and regulations by harassing tenants .
New York State Homes and Community Renewal said that the Tenant Protection Unit has launched an investigation at the Austin Nichols House in Brooklyn . "
Governor Cuomo has zero tolerance for tenant abuse of any kind and we will aggressively take on landlords who try to intimidate people out of their homes , " said RuthAnne Visnauskas , commissioner of New York State Homes and Community Renewal , in a statement . "
In New York , no one is above the law , and we will thoroughly investigate the appalling allegations of harassment at this or any related property and hold anyone found guilty of such abuse responsible to the fullest extent of the law . "
Tenants of the Austin Nichols House alleged in a lawsuit that Kushner Co.s engaged in a campaign aimed at pushing rent stabilized tenants out of their apartments by starting construction projects that created toxins , attracted vermin and made loud noise .
New York is the city that never sleeps .
But some New Yorkers have a different way of looking at it . "
New York is a city that never stops , " says Lindsay Goldwert , an editorial director at personal - finance site Stash .
She s not wrong : Its a city with more than 8.5 million people who are all paying some of the highest rents in the country , commuting to work on crowded subway system that some say is desperately in need of an upgrade -- and then the there s constant noise . "
People come to New York to achieve a dream , " she said . "
Its a tough city .
People work very hard .
Often , people here have a second job in the evening .
It often makes for a lot of stress , despite having worked a ludicrous amount during the day .
You do nt live here to have a normal life . " "

People work very hard .
Often , people here have a second job in the evening . " --
Lindsay Goldwert , editorial director at Stash Normal or not , all that stress adds up .
In fact , there are more obese New Yorkers than there were a decade ago , and many report issues with depression and diabetes , according to a series of New York University School of Medicine and New York City Health department studies published this week in the Journal of Urban Health .
What s more , about 41 % of New Yorkers said they had problems sleeping .
Researchers analyzed physical examinations and laboratory tests and interviewed more than 1,500 residents between 2004 and 2014 , including a sample population that represented different genders , races and other characteristics in New York Citys five boroughs .
Do nt miss : Poor New Yorkers suffer more when the subway is delayed That s a problem .
Lack of sleep is a " public health epidemic " in the U.S. , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . "
Unintentionally falling asleep , nodding off while driving , and having difficulty performing daily tasks because of sleepiness all may contribute to these hazardous outcomes , the report says .
Those experiencing a prolonged lack of sleep are also more likely to suffer from chronic diseases such as hypertension , diabetes , depression , and obesity , and cancer , increased mortality , and reduced quality of life and productivity . " '
Were online all the time .
We order food from Seamless because we do nt to cook .

Lindsay Goldwert Working long hours and sleeping fewer hours is a bad combination .
Workplace performance deteriorates when sleep is restricted to six hours per night for a week and does not improve after two nights of recovery sleep , according to a paper presented to the 2013 meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies .
Long work days and commutes take their toll , especially when you are chasing your dreams like millions of New Yorkers before you . "
By the time you get home at night , its difficult to turn around and want to go out again , " according to Goldwert , who also hosts a podcast , " Teach Me How to Money . "
She performed standup comedy in the evening for five years at venues across the city , but she put these ambitions on hiatus when she started at Stash in 2017 . "
I could nt have it all .
It was really brutal .
I felt like I d lost a huge part of myself when I gave up standup .
It was something I had to do for my own sanity .
Otherwise , I would never have come home . " "
Before we had the term side hustle , people were working two jobs , " Goldwert added . "
And were very caught up politically .
New York City overwhelmingly voted for ' not our president , so were online all the time .
We order food from Seamless because we do nt to cook .
Were in bed with our phones and the day begins again .
I m married with no children .
I ca nt imagine what its like for people with children . "
Do nt miss : The 21st Century has not been the American Century Not everyone can manage Goldwerts work / life balance .
The mental health of New Yorkers has suffered between 2004 and 2014 .
More than half - a - million New Yorkers ( 8.3 % ) said they had symptoms of depression , with higher rates reported by women and Latinos .
What s more , many said they were not receiving mental health counseling or taking medication for it .
The number of obese New Yorkers also increased from 27 % to 32 % between 2004 and 2014 and were mostly men , the data showed .
Black New Yorkers had the highest rate of obesity ( 37 % ) and Asians saw the largest jump ( from 20 % to 29 % ) .
People who had no high school education , lacked health insurance and were immigrants saw greater increases in obesity than others .
Men had higher rates of risk for heart disease compared with women , and were more likely to suffer from hypertension .
White women had better heart health than any other women and all men , while black women were at the greatest risk for health problems , with a 20 % greater likelihood than white men of being overweight or obese . (
There was one upside : The levels of obesity in New York City were less severe than in the rest of the country . )
Recommended : How The New Yorker tote became a bigger status symbol than a $ 10,000 Hermes bag New Yorkers also did nt show any change in the amount of physical exercise they get , but there was a significant uptick in New Yorkers reporting that they spend more than three hours a day watching television or videos on the web ( a 32 % increase from 2004 to 2014 ) .
One theory on why : Eating out and going to the movies costs a lot of money in New York City . "
There s so much stimulation , sometimes its nice to go home and shut off , " Goldwert said . "
New York is an expensive place .
Watching Netflix NFLX , -3.76 % is less expensive than going out . "
The cost of living in New York City is almost 69 % higher than the national average , according to personal - finance site SmartAsset .
Sari Botton , editor of the anthology " Goodbye to All That : Writers on Loving and Leaving New York , " said she moved upstate because she was priced out of her apartment in the East Village . "
It was nt a choice I would have made if I did nt have to , but I m glad we left , " she said . "
I still miss the city and I go when I can , but often when I m there I think , ' I ca nt imagine how you live here . "
Botton said she s noticed more chain stores during her visits , and that a lot of her favorite places have closed .
The city is also much more crowded than when she left in 2005 , she said .
There were more than 8.54 million people living in New York City in 2016 , up from 7.94 million in 2005 , according to the U.S. Census Bureau . "
The cost of living in New York City is almost 69 % higher than the national average , according to personal - finance site SmartAsset . "
Even legislators have noted how overcrowded it is .
In 2017 , the city enacted a bill to study locations with significant pedestrian traffic and develop strategies to alleviate those bottlenecks .

Still , even poor New Yorkers tend to live longer than low - income people in other cities , according to a 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that looked at Social Security and earnings records .
And the gap in life expectancy rates between rich and poor in New York was smaller ( 4.8 years ) than in other major U.S. cities .
Low - income residents of New York City live 81.8 years on average .
Gary , Indiana ranks the bottom of that list ( 77.4 years on average ) .
Rich New Yorkers die sooner than top earners in other cities .
The highest earners of Salt Lake City live 87.8 years on average , followed by Portland , Maine and Spokane , Wash. And New York is still ranked 10th in the list of healthiest states , following others like Hawaii , Vermont and Colorado , according to Americas Health Rankings in 2017 .
Massachusetts was ranked first .
New York made the biggest gain , the report found , jumping from No .

But that s not enough for some residents of New York City .
Playwright Lisa Tierney - Keogh is leaving New York City after a decade to move back to her hometown of Dublin , Ireland .
She had grown adept at navigating the citys sleepless , stressed - out and sometimes cranky characters . "

Despite my clear exasperation with New York , we ve come to terms with one another , " she added . "

New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman is among the 150 high school classmates who signed a letter in support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh , according to a story posted on the Arizona Cardinals ' web site Monday night .
Cashman also previously spoke out in support of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch when he was nominated last year , calling him " extremely intelligent " and " a tremendous choice " in an interview with The New York Daily News in February 2017 .
Cashman , Gorsuch , Kavanaugh and Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill all attended Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda , Md. , together in the mid-1980s .
The letter , which was emailed to Senate leaders on Monday after President Trump announced Kavanaugh 's nomination , was spearheaded by Bidwill , a longtime friend who attended Kavanaugh 's wedding , according to the team .
Cashman , 51 , graduated from Georgetown Prep in 1985 , two years after Kavanaugh .

NORTH AUGUSTA , S.C. - Going in to the FIBA U17 World Cup , DeVion Harmon was told that bringing home the gold would be easier the second time around .
Harmon was a part of the U16 gold medal team last year .
But after helping the USA U17 National team knockoff France 95 - 52 last week in Argentina , Harmon said that notion is " absolutely not true at all . " "
No way , " Harmon said . "
It was a lot of hard work and sacrifice , but we got it done .
It was the perfect scenario for me headed into Peach Jam . "
Its a sentiment shared by the handful of players at Peach Jam who are coming off the emotional high that accompanies capturing gold .
Of the 12 players on USA Basketballs U17 roster , eight play on the Nike circuit . "
Its a great feeling winning the gold medal , " said Isaac Okoro , who played in the U17 team and is suiting up with AOT ( Ga. ) this week . "
Just to be able to win for your country and now carry that over into Peach Jam is something I think will help me out a lot . "
Houston Hoops ( Texas ) guard Tyrese Maxey said that the biggest benefit from winning the gold is mentally .
Maxey was a part of the USA U18 National team that won the gold in Canada last month . "
It just gives you so much more confidence , " said Maxey , a Kentucky commit . "
You beat the best players in the world who play different styles than you .
It just makes you feel like you re ready for anything . "

Northrop Grumman NOC , -0.81 % announced Thursday afternoon that Chief Executive Wes Bush will step down at the end of this year and be replaced by Kathy Warden , the company 's president and chief operating officer .
Bush will remain chairman of the company through July 2019 , the company said . "
I am delighted that Kathy will become our company 's next CEO , " Bush said in Thursday 's announcement . "
She has demonstrated exceptional leadership in her roles leading the operations of our company , and she brings the vision and values to lead Northrop Grumman into the future . "
The large defense contractor was embroiled in controversy last week , when ProPublica revealed that a Northrop Grumman employee who was part of a violent white - supremacist group had received a top U.S. security clearance .
The employee lost his job a day after the report was published , and Bush sent an email to staff saying he was " deeply saddened " by the report , according to ProPublica .
When asked if the change was related to the controversy , a Northrop Grumman spokesman said " the timing of Wes ' retirement is the result of a very focused and disciplined succession planning process , " noting that Warden was named president and COO a year ago in preparation .
Northrop Grumman stock dipped 0.4 % in late trading Thursday afternoon following the announcement of a new CEO , but has gained 5 % so far this year as the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % has gained 4.7 % .
Now ON BROADWAY : the music of the Go - Go 's , a one - of - a - kind band .
They talked with our Tracy Smith : The Go - Go 's , the barrier - breaking 1980 's hitmakers , have stood on a lot of stages .
But never this one . "
That 's your Broadway theatre ! "
said " Head Over Heels " director Michael Mayer . "
Barbra was on this stage , too . " "
Barbra who ? "
asked Jane Wiedlin . "
Barbra Streisand , remember her ? "
he laughed .
Watch the full story here : They 're in Streisand territory because the Go - Go 's phenomenon has come to Broadway .
They do n't actually appear in the new musical comedy , " Head Over Heels , " but some years ago , a Broadway producer thought it would be a great idea to artfully insert Go - Go 's songs into an Elizabethan - era story about a royal family and a prophecy that could spell their doom .
This is not their life stories . "
Yes , thank you for clarifying that ! "
laughed Kathy Valentine . "
We were not born in the 1580s ! "
said Wiedlin and Belinda Carlisle . "
Even though , sometimes we might feel like it ! "
quipped Charlotte Caffey .
They may feel that way because they 've done the walk from dressing room to stage hundreds , maybe thousands of times . "
We 're all really good at doing this - we are really , really good at being Go - Go 's , " Valentine said .
On - and - off for 40 years now , Valentine , Wiedlin , Caffey , Carlisle and Gina Schock get together to show why the Go - Go 's have been called one of the most successful all - female bands in the history of rock ' n ' roll .
Smith asked , " When you 're up onstage looking out at the audience , what do you see ? " "
Grandparents , parents , kids , " said Carlisle . "
It 's thrilling , you know , that our music has that kind of appeal . "
That 's not the way it began in 1978 , when Belinda Carlisle and Jane Wiedlin decided , somewhat naively , to form a group . "
We came from the punk rock scene in L.A. , where anything went and you could learn as you went along , " Carlisle said . "
And we had no idea how to play our instruments or do anything . " "
We were absolutely rotten when we started , " said Wiedlin .
Rough , maybe , but enough to attract other members who 'd actually played music before - drummer Gina Shock ( who missed our interview because of surgery ) , bassist Kathy Valentine , and guitarist Charlotte Caffey , who was trained in classical piano . "
So , I was in awe , I was a little scared of them .
But it was kind of exciting !
They were the cool girls that were punky .
And I was kind of more , like , you know , reserved and straight .
Kind of . "
It 's hard to imagine now , but in their early days , each band member made about $ 40 a week .
And they had plenty of proverbial doors slammed in their faces . "
Every door , " Wiedlin said .
According to Carlisle record executives would not sign them " because we were women , or girls .
We were girls then ! "
But the " girls " did make it happen . "
We Got the Beat " became the Go - Go 's first hit in England and then in the United States .
Like almost all of their music , it was written , arranged and performed by all women .
Smith asked , " What did that do to have it be all - female ? " "
I think it emboldened us , " Wiedlin replied . "
I mean , especially the five of us , we 've always said , like , we 're this five - headed monster when we 're together .
It 's this ball of energy that can be a force for good or a force for evil ! "
Truth is , underneath all the fun and fizz was something a little more serious .
You can hear it in " Our Lips Are Sealed , " upbeat but with lyrics that are a little dark : Can you hear them ?
They talk about us Telling lies Well , that 's no surprise .
Can you see them ?
See right through them They have no shield No secrets to reveal . "
That 's kind of a Go - Go trademark that we always make an effort not to make something , like , 100 % happy or 100 % sad , " said Wiedlin . "
We like to mix things together to keep things more interesting . "
Caffey added , " That kind of dark against happiness , it 's really , I love it . "
And the same goes for their 1982 hit , " Vacation . "
The video seems happy - go - lucky , until you look a little closer .
Wiedlin recalled : " That video , that was , like , a 14-hour shoot , and we were so bored and miserable that we all started drinking . ...
This part in the video where it looks like we 're on the [ water ] skis and we were so drunk by then , if you , like , look at our eyes , we 're all like ... ! "
And while they all seemed chummy at a People magazine photo session a few weeks ago , the band 's history has n't been so happy - go - lucky , either : Medical problems , drug and alcohol abuse , and several knock - down , drag - out breakups .
Wiedlin said , " Over the past , we always keep hurting each other and then keep forgiving each other and then healing and then trying to grow .
And that 's how I feel that we are all at this point . "
Think a group of sisters who can be extremely close , but at the same time , light years apart .
Valentine said , " There 's been times we 're in the dressing room , throwing stuff at each other .
I think somebody got hit once !
There 's a lot of conflicting energy .
But somehow , out of all of that , something stays very intact and still works very well .
There 's always a little eye in the hurricane that stays really nice , you know ?
And special . "
They do get along well enough to still play as a band .
Recently , to the surprise of the audience , the Go - Go 's performed onstage with the " Head Over Heels " cast .
While they can cross Broadway off their bucket list , the Go - Go 's still have one more mountain to climb : Smith said , " A lot of your fans think that there 's a grave injustice that you guys are not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . "
Wiedlin said , " You ca n't take away the fact that we were the very first successful all - female band who wrote all their own songs and played all their own instruments . "
Hall of Fame honors of not , when you 're a Go - Go , it just does n't seem right to stop .
In 10 or 15 years time , they could be on stage together , and Valentine noted , " All the record companies , will say , ' There 's never been an all - granny band before ' ! "
Which may be their ticket to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .

Nowadays , more and more people are ditching traditional cable subscription packages in favor of streaming TV and movies on services like Netflix , Hulu Plus , HBO Now , and so on .
It 's so ubiquitous that there 's a whole line of devices -- called streaming devices -- that exist solely in order to make it easier to get streaming content on your TV .
When it comes to streaming devices , the most popular options are Roku , Apple TV , and Amazon Fire .
These little devices plug right into your TV and can be controlled by a remote control , making them the cheapest and most convenient way to get streaming content on your TV ( unless you have a smart TV , anyway ) .
If you 're thinking about getting a streaming box , you 're likely going to end up choosing between Apple TV , Roku , and Amazon Fire -- but which one is best for you ?
Here 's what you need to know about prices , specs , and functionality to make the right choice .
Or you could skip all that and just check out our exhaustively tested list of the best streaming devices .
ADVERTISEMENT Credit : Apple Apple TV 4 K How much does it cost ? :
The Apple TV 4 K tops out at 199.99 for the 64 GB 4 K version .
The 32 GB model costs 179.99 and the Apple TV HD ( which only comes in a 32 GB configuration ) is 149.99 .
What we like about Apple TV : The newest iteration plays 4 K content as well as HDR ( High Dynamic Range ) with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos sound .
It uses a powerful A8 processor and runs the slick tvOS interface .
It features most of the major streaming players , with well - designed apps from Netflix , HBO , Showtime , Hulu , DirecTV Now , Amazon , Youtube , and a host of other players .
The Siri remote is still a sore point among users ( especially the iffy touchpad ) , but it 's a big improvement over older Apple TV remotes and includes voice search and voice entry for passwords and things like that .
Apple is also attempting to corral the most popular streaming options with a single " TV " app that you 'd only have to sign into once .
It 's a good idea that needs some work .
What we do n't like about Apple TV : Apple 's interface looks great , but it 's not the easiest to navigate .
Apple 's TV app could theoretically fix this , bringing content from all your favorite apps into one interface , but it does n't bring in Netflix shows or movies .
That said , the only other major drawback here is cost .
The most expensive ( and best ) Roku device is just $ 99 .
Though you can usually find the Apple TV 4 K for around $ 150 on sale , that 's still a big price jump over a competitor that has almost all the same features .
Credit : Roku Roku How much does it cost ? :
There are a variety of models available from the Roku Ultra for $ 99 to the Roku Express for $ 29.99 .
There are many models in between with subtle difference , but basically , the Roku Express plays 1080p content with a simple remote , the Premiere takes you up to 4 K , for $ 39.99 .
ADVERTISEMENT The Premiere+ add a voice remote for $ 49.00 .
The Streaming Stick for $ 49.99 gives you a dongle for the back for your TV .
The Streaming Stick+ adds 4 K for $ 59.99 .
And the aforementioned Roku Ultra costs $ 99.99 and gives you a wired internet connection , and headphone jack in the remote for private TV watching .
The lowest level Rokus are still the Express and Express+ , which go for $ 29.99 and $ 35 , respectively .
They 're both basic 1080p streamers and do n't support HDR .
The main difference is the Express+ has composite AV cables that can output to older TVs and A / V systems that do n't have HDMI ports .
What we like about Roku : Roku has been around for nearly a decade , with a clear focus on streaming video from apps like Netflix .
It has support for all the major players , and is totally platform agnostic , unlike Apple and Amazon which both heavily promote their own content and partners .
ADVERTISEMENT The Roku itself is generally beginner - friendly , with a dead - simple interface and an easy - to - use remote that features dedicated buttons providing one - touch access to popular apps like Netflix .
The more advanced models also feature a headphone jack on the remote , so you can listen to your TV wirelessly while streaming without needing dedicated gear .
What we do n't like about Roku : Roku 's interface is n't as slick as the competition these days and some of the newer apps lag slightly behind the competition because of that -- though that 's getting better .
Also while some models include voice search in the remote that can cut across around 100 popular services , it does n't have the wider feature set of smart assistants like Siri and Alexa .
And while having so many streaming boxes means you have options across the price spectrum , the differences can be hard to suss out .
Credit : Amazon Amazon Fire TV with Remote Amazon Fire TV How much does it cost ? :
The Fire TV comes in several flavors right now : the 1080p - supporting Fire TV Stick for $ 39.99 , the 4 K and HDR - capable Fire TV for $ 69.99 , and the new Fire TV Cube for $ 119.99 .
ADVERTISEMENT What we like about the Fire TV : All of the Amazon Fire TV devices support searching for content with your voice , and all ship with voice - enabled remotes ( the Cube itself has mics built right into it , like the Echo Dot ) .
Alexa can search across tons of popular apps , set reminders , automatically rewind or fast forward what you 're watching , and even control your smart home devices .
Fire TV is also a very robust streaming platform , with support for all the top apps and services .
I 've personally had a few issues with certain apps on the Fire TV stick ( HBO Now seems to crash periodically and needs to be uninstalled and reinstalled ) , but overall the experience is seamless .
What we do n't like about the Fire TV : Amazon does a fantastic job of surfacing content for the user in horizontal bars ( similar to how Netflix organizes its content ) .
While it can ( and does ) pull in popular content from services like Netflix , it really comes into its own with a Prime subscription .
Prime is 100 % worth it , but if you do n't have Prime and do n't use Alexa , we 'd recommend Roku hands - down .
ADVERTISEMENT The Fire TV Stick is also not the fastest streaming solution .
Though it has lots of features ( considering its affordable price ) , the processing power feels lacking .
It 's faster than the similarly priced Roku options ( the Express and Stick ) , but still sluggish .
I used one for several months and Alexa seemed borderline unresponsive at times .
It 's the best sub-$50 option , but we strongly recommend jumping up to the $ 89 Fire TV or Roku Premiere+ .
Voice search on all the Fire TV devices is astoundingly good , and Alexa on these devices can do everything it can do on all other Echo devices .
The new Fire TV Cube takes this to the next level , with a built - in mic for truly hands - free control of your TV , and IR blasters for controlling devices in the room .
Which should you buy ?
Roku vs Amazon vs Apple TV All three platforms have their pros and cons .
Apple 's has the best design and high - end features like Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos , but it 's way more expensive .
Roku 's the best about giving every service a level playing field and it has the best remote , but it lacks the polish and smart features of the competition .
Amazon has great hardware , Alexa , and a lovely interface -- but it 's at its best only when you have a Prime subscription .
For most people , it 'll come down to which platform has the hardware and features that match their interests .
Overall , we 'd recommend the 2018 Roku Ultra for most people .
It supports 4 K , HDR , has the best remote , has voice search , and it 's just $ 100 ( less on sale ) .
The Apple TV 4 K is a very compelling option for people who have higher - end entertainment systems , own a lot of Apple devices , have bought a lot of iTunes movies , or just plain like Apple more .
It 's expensive , and most people wo n't benefit from the extra features , but it 's a great all - around streaming device .
The Fire TV devices are ideal if you have a Prime subscription and already use Alexa for a ton of stuff .
The new Fire TV Cube seems to have some real issues , but we love the mid - range Fire TV and that supports 4K / HDR as well .
Oaktree Capital co - chairman Howard Marks said the U.S. economy was in its 8th inning , indicating it is the final stages of economic expansion , at CNBC 's Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Wednesday .
But the baseball analogy only has so much to give , Marks said , because " this is n't baseball and we do n't know how many innings there will be . "
The late - stage economy is leading investors to push out their growth horizons , Marks said .
And while that was symptomatic of optimism in the prolonged growth cycle , it also has left investors unprepared for a sudden turnaround in the economy . "
In the later stages of the cycles , people tend to come up with rationalization for why it wo n't end . "
With that sentiment in mind , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % us up 1.9 % year to date , while the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % has advanced by 5.3 % over the same period .

Ocado , the online supermarket and technology company , reported a 13.9 percent fall in first - half core earnings on Tuesday , reflecting a step - up in investment in the business .
It said it expected earning trends to improve in the second half of the year however and it also maintained its forecast for retail revenue growth of 10 - 15 percent for the full 2018 year , assuming economic conditions remain broadly stable .
The group , whose share price has soared 256 percent over the last year on the back of four major overseas partnership deals , made earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortisation ( EBITDA ) of 38.9 million pounds ( $ 51.5 million ) in the 26 weeks to June 3 .
Ocado had warned in February that investment in its UK distribution centres and software platform would put a brake on earnings this year .
It said capital expenditure would be 210 million pounds in 2018 , up from 160 million pounds in 2017 .
The firm struck its biggest deal so far , with U.S. supermarket chain Kroger , in May. That followed deals with Sweden 's ICA Group , Canada 's Sobeys and France 's Casino .

Oil market disruptions and limited supply ca n't keep oil prices at bay Helena Croft of RBC and Chris Midgley of S&P Global Platts discuss disruptions in the oil market .
Oil prices ended higher Wednesday , finding support from a bigger - than - expected decline in gasoline stocks , despite a surprise climb in domestic crude supplies and record weekly production .
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , August West Texas Intermediate crude US : CLQ8 rose 1 % , or 68 cents , to settle at $ 68.76 a barrel after an intraday low of $ 67.04 .
September Brent oil UK : LCOU8 tacked on 1 % , or 74 cents , to $ 72.90 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange .
Prices have now posted gains for two sessions in a row , but Brent had teased correction territory at the lows of the day .
A finish below $ 71.82 would mark its entry into correction territory , down at least 10 % from its May high of $ 79.80 .

The Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that domestic crude supplies climbed 5.8 million barrels for the week ended July 13 .
Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts had forecast a fall of 3 million barrels , while the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday reported a rise of 629,000 barrels .
The report also showed that domestic production climbed by 100,000 barrels a day to 11 million barrels a day .
That s the highest weekly level on record , based on EIA data dating back to at least 1985 . "
During this time of year , we usually see draws in the crude complex , " said Tariq Zahir , managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors . "
To see a build this large is quite surprising and we feel with the increased production coming out of Saudi Arabia and Russia should put the brakes on the recent strength on crude prices . "
Gasoline stockpiles declined by 3.2 million barrels for the week , while distillate stockpiles fell by 400,000 barrels , according to the EIA .
The S&P Global Platts survey forecast supply decreases of 1 million barrels for gasoline and 45,000 barrels for distillate stocks . "
Strong demand for gasoline and distillate changed the mood " for oil , said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group . "
Most feel the increase in crude supply was due to a drop in refinery runs [ because of ] some short term glitches . "
On Nymex , August gasoline US : RBQ8 settled at $ 2.044 a gallon , up 0.9 % , while August heating oil US : HOQ8 added 1 % to $ 2.090 a gallon .
Ahead of Thursdays EIA data on supplies , August natural gas US : NGQ18 fell 0.7 % to $ 2.721 per million British thermal units .
A teleconference between members of the joint OPEC and non - OPEC ministerial monitoring committee Wednesday failed to offer any market - moving news .
In a statement , the committee said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies reached a production - cut agreement compliance level of 121 % in July , down from 147 % in May. The group is comprised of Saudi Arabia , Russia , the United Arab Emirates , Kuwait , Algeria , Venezuela and Oman , but Reuters had reported that the call was also joined by OPEC member Iran .
Overall , its been a volatile week for oil .
Prices managed modest gains Tuesday after dropping more than 4 % a day earlier .
Recent news of a production outage in Libya served as a reminder that overall supplies remain volatile . "
Even with the U.S. hitting record output , traders are still concerned about conflicts in Libya , " said Nicholas Gunther , market research analyst at Long Leaf Trading .
Despite that , he feels that the " fundamental aspects are still bearish " for oil given those record production levels .
The early - week tumble came after reports that President Donald Trumps administration was considering releasing oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and news of possible waivers on U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil .
Month to date , both benchmark trade at least 7 % lower . " '
If indeed , the output drop from Iran is accompanied by what I might call production ' hernias for Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the UAE , the chance of a spike above $ 100 / bbl has returned . " --
Tom Kloza , OPIS Still , Tom Kloza , global head of energy analysis at Oil Price Information Service , warned that " If indeed , the output drop from Iran is accompanied by what I might call production ' hernias for Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the UAE , the chance of a spike above $ 100 / bbl has returned . "
Iranian crude output may be knocked down by perhaps 1 million barrels a day by the end of 2018 , and possibly another few hundred thousand barrels day next year , he said .
Meanwhile , S&P Global Platts reported , citing sources familiar with deliberations , that OPECs legal department was set to meet Thursday to consider options to counter so - called NOPEC legislation in the U.S. that would revoke the groups sovereign immunity , as Trumps recent tweets about OPEC have raised alarm .

On Sunday , Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company managed to meet a self - imposed deadline to produce 5,000 Model 3 cars in a week .
The car maker had been under intense pressure to deliver on the sedan , something seen by analysts as integral to Tesla breaking into the mainstream .
Tesla has repeatedly missed production targets and failed to reach profitability .
Despite those factors , the company pulled out all the stops to produce 7000 cars in total last week .
On Sunday , Musk sent an effusively worded communication to all employees , thanking them for their hard work , adding that the company became " a real car company " in the process .
CNBC obtained a copy of the email Musk sent to Tesla staffers , which can be read in full below : From : Elon Musk To : Everybody Subj .
7000 Jul. 1 , 12:37 PM We did it ! !
What an incredible job by an amazing team .
Could nt be more proud to work with you .
It is an honor .
The level of dedication and creativity was mind - blowing .
We either found a way or , by will and inventiveness , created entirely new solutions that were thought impossible .
Intense in tents .
Transporting entire production lines across the world in massive cargo planes .
Whatever .
It worked .
Not only did we factory gate over 5000 Model 3s , but we also achieved the S & X production target for a combined 7000 vehicle week !
What s more , with the widespread productivity gains throughout Tesla and the new production lines spooling up , we are on track to reach 6k / week for Model 3 next month .
I think we just became a real car company ... Thank you for your hard work and dedication , Elon
On Wall Street , FAANG is spelled with two As , and means " big win " for their lucky shareholders -- which likely includes you .
FAANG stands for Facebook , FB , -4.27 % Amazon , Apple , Netflix and Google ( representing parent company , Alphabet GOOG , -0.59 % ) , a collection of tech companies so widely followed by investors that the media came up with an acronym for them .
Each company has been known to move markets and transform not just their own industries , but also how we all live .
Consider Amazon .
AMZN , -1.81 % ( It was the original " A " when Jim Cramer first coined the term to quickly refer to the group of fast - growing tech stocks ; Apple was added later . )
The online megastore has made shopping fast , easy and accessible , crushing its competition and completely changing the way retail operates .
Many consumers now expect to be able to purchase anything and everything -- from clothes , groceries and gadgets to a personalized " Game of Thrones " music box -- anytime , with one click and free shipping .
Check out : MarketWatch & Learn : How to buy stocks , bonds , mutual funds , ETFs ... Amazons investors may have equally high expectations .
Five years ago , the companys share price was around $ 300 ; it ended the first week of July above $ 1,700 a share .
And with a current market capitalization of about $ 830 billion , its the third - heaviest component of S&P 500 index , behind Apple AAPL , -0.32 % and Microsoft .
MSFT , -0.15 % Even the smallest FAANG member , Netflix , NFLX , -3.76 % is a heavy hitter .
Its market cap is about $ 177 billion , weighing in at 0.75 % of the S&P 500 .
And over the past five years , its shares have skyrocketed from less than $ 40 in July 2013 to more than $ 400 last week .
Together , the five companies make up approximately 13 % of the index with a collective market cap of nearly $ 3.8 trillion .
So if FAANG was a country , and its market cap was its gross domestic product , that s big enough to make it the fourth - largest economy in the world .
So , should I buy them ?
Well , the groups history of success certainly warrants consideration , but whether each company can maintain the heady growth is debatable .
Then there s the issue of price : To buy just one share of each FAANG stock , you d need more than $ 3,600 total ( as of July 9 ) .
And keep in mind that five U.S. large tech stocks does nt exactly make for a diversified portfolio .
Luckily , there s an easier , much cheaper way to buy into FAANG stocks while protecting yourself from any potential slowdown .
In fact , its so easy that you re probably already doing it .
See : Heres a hedge for investors against inflated FAANG stocks Plenty of mutual funds and exchange - traded funds ( ETFs)--including index funds that track the S&P 500 , of course -- count FAANGs among their holdings .
So if you own any stock funds , you can check your funds prospectus to see how much you have in FAANGs already .
You ll also notice that these types of funds also give you a stake in hundreds of other companies at the same time .
That means you get exposure to the worlds most popular stocks while maintaining a diversified portfolio in one fell swoop -- a smart and easy investing strategy to build and preserve your wealth over the long term .

One of the biggest ideas in the payments industry is called biometrics .
All you need to make a payment ?
Your voice , your face , your fingerprint , maybe even your heartbeat .
Hello Knomi , please verify my identity .
There we are , successful .
Now you 'd be able to go ahead with the payment , go on with your day ?
Go ahead and buy something .
It 's that simple .
You 're literally just using your face and your voice to make that payment ?
Face and voice .
You always have them with you , you ca n't forget them . [
Carl - Michael Heuveldop , Aware ] " Instead of entering a pin or a password to activate the payment you would use your face , or the voice as another option . "
Biometrics like your voice are increasingly being used to authenticate payments from devices like mobile phones .
And thanks to home assistants like Amazon Echo or Google Home - voice payments are becoming a fast and easy way to make purchases without ever leaving the house - or even the sofa [ Stephen Ritter , Mitek Systems ] " It 's basically teaching computers to understand your voice and match that voice to your identity . //
now through a simple voice command you 'd be able to say Alexa please buy so and so for me .
And then Alexa would be able to say yep , that 's Steve Ritter 's voice , I 'm going to go ahead and make that purchase for him . "
Research shows voice assistants are most commonly used to seek information - like the news or the weather - and to play music and videos .
But retail is becoming a bigger function with 35 % of consumers using voice to buy products like groceries , home care or clothes .
The voice shopping market is expected to grow to $ 40 billion in 2022 , up from $ 2 billion today .
And right now , it 's dominated by a few big players : Amazon , Google and Microsoft . [
Kai - Christian Claus , EY ] " If you become as a provider , like the top payment method of one of those large platforms the probability that you really outbeat everything and everybody in the market is quite high . "
But there are still obstacles to making purchases with just our voice . [
Stephen Ritter ] " just as easy it is for me to make a payment using my voice and my Amazon account , erm , somebody else could use that to make purchases either for theft or maybe more , um , importantly money laundering . "
But some experts say biometrics are n't the problem , they 're the solution , to making payments safer . [
Ajay Bhalla , Mastercard ] " the most common password is . //
Biometrics actually changes the consumer experience and actually makes it more secure too . "
With a recent survey showing 93 % of consumers prefer biometrics over traditional passwords - it might not be too long before voice payments go mainstream .
One of the newest broadband TV services , Philo , is expanding its reach .
The $ 16 monthly streaming subscription service , which launched in November on Roku devices , desktop and web browsers and iPhones , is now available on Amazon TV and Apple TV , the video service said Tuesday .
Philo is also getting a boost of more than $ 40 million in investment funding , led by AMC Networks , Discovery and Viacom .
Those three major programmers along with A&E and Scripps provided the initial investment of $ 25 million to help launch the service . (
Discovery acquired Scripps in July 2017 for $ 11.9 billion . )
The dual - pronged initiative will likely raise the awareness of Philo , which includes A&E , AMC , BET , Comedy Central , Discovery Channel , HGTV , OWN and another 30-plus channels . "
Nobody knows Philo exists , " said Rich Greenfield , a media and technology analyst with financial services firm BTIG in New York . "
The device partnerships are going to provide a good amount of visibility from a marketing standpoint in terms of how Amazon markets around Prime Day and how Apple promotes this . "
It 's no accident that Philo 's arrival on Amazon 's Fire TV happens just days before the online retailing giant 's Amazon Prime Day on July 16 .
And the funding will help raise awareness of the streaming service long after Amazon 's online sales event . "
I hear a lot of people online who say they love Philo and they re surprised they do nt see advertisements for the company in more places , " said Philo 's CEO Andrew McCollum . "
That s one thing we will be changing with the funding . "
McCollum declined to reveal the size of Philo 's current subscriber base , but said " we 're really happy with the growth . "

Oregon 's contingent of hemp farmers could soon find it easier to work with banks and university extension offices as two unlikely allies on Capitol Hill ramp up efforts to legalize the close cousin of marijuana .
With a bill before Congress , Sen. Ron Wyden , D - Oregon , and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Kentucky , hope to pull hemp from a federal list of controlled substances , a move aimed at opening a lucrative market dominated by foreign farmers to more U.S. growers .
Oregon already has a robust hemp industry that boasts almost 500 growers in the 2018 calendar year , including a combined 45 in Marion and Polk counties , according to state data .
But that does n't mean they 're treated like farmers growing classic Oregon cherries or Christmas trees .
MORE : Trump agrees to leave state - legal pot programs alone Because hemp remains federally illegal , banks generally shy away from growers , as do federally - funded university extension offices whose officials may otherwise be able to identify pests threatening the crops , saide Sunny Jones , the Oregon Department of Agriculture 's cannabis policy coordinator .
Meanwhile , nearly 150 handlers are registered to transform raw hemp into something marketable like cannabidiol ( CBD ) extract .
Hemp has only minuscule amounts of psychoactive compound tetrahydrocannabinol , commonly known as THC .
Shoppers can find hemp in any number of products , from shampoos to hoodies to snacks .
Farmers in Oregon primarily grow hemp for CBD production , Jones said .
The state does n't produce hemp fiber , for instance , as that requires specialized equipment that 's just not available here yet .
OPINION : Rapid Response : Should federal government step back , let states legalize pot ?
Retailers across Oregon can sell hemp products as long as their THC concentration is 0.3 percent or lower .
But things can still get dicey if hemp growers try to move their product across state lines . "
That is questionable , because then you have federal regulations that come into play , " Jones said .
In 2014 , lawmakers laid the groundwork for states to create programs for hemp cultivation .
Provisions introduced under Wyden 's and McConnell 's Hemp Farming Act of 2018 would further loosen federal restrictions , classifying hemp as an agricultural commodity and handing states the power to regulate production .
In addition , the provisions would allow hemp farmers to procure crop insurance and let researchers apply for U.S. Department of Agriculture grants .
When McConnell asked Wyden what he thought about including the provisions in this year 's farm bill , he replied : " I feel like I 've been shot in the tailbone with good luck . " "
The majority leader wants to put our bill in the farm bill ?
You know that 's going to become law , " Wyden said in a recent interview .
MORE : Sen .
Ron Wyden cosponsors bill to legalize marijuana across U.S. Both the House and the Senate passed versions of the farm bill last month , but only the Senate version includes the hemp provisions .
Lawmakers plan to meet in the coming weeks to work out the differences in the legislation .
In floor remarks on the day senators passed the bill , McConnell blamed American farmers ' inability to meet demand for the crop on " outdated federal regulations that do not sufficiently distinguish this industrial crop from its illicit cousin . " "
It 's left consumers with little choice but to buy imported hemp products from foreign - produced hemp , " McConnell said .
Wyden said farmers in Canada and China " must laugh all the way to the bank . "
The bill would ease the way for farmers to capitalize on a retail market that 's valued at $ 688 million , according to estimates released last year by Hemp Business Journal and advocates with Vote Hemp .
That market , which includes household products such as food , personal care products and supplements , is expected to breach $ 1.8 billion in sales in 2020 .

Our 2015 Costa Rica honeymoon marked the first time my wife Vanessa and I had ever traveled outside the country -- and the start of our wanderlust .
The lush rain forest , dreamy waterfalls and exhilaration of being somewhere new prompted one big question : Could we travel the world before starting a family ?
We made it our mission to do just that , saving up $ 27,000 in the following 10 months for a yearlong trip .
Heres exactly how we did it .
Breaking it down : defining a goal and creating a budget to match At home , Vanessa and I started unpacking the details .
We began by listing our bucket - list experiences -- from sipping wine in Rome to connecting with relatives in Romania .
We wanted to take our time in each place and soak up the culture , which led us to our goal : Jet off for an entire year of European travel .
Just one snag : I was a manager at a local retail store , and Vanessa worked in marketing at a casino .
Together , we earned $ 68,000 a year .
So we did nt have a boatload of disposable income to fund our adventures .
We needed an airtight plan , and lots of discipline , to make it happen .
Step one was figuring out the cost .
We scoured blogs , Airbnbs and discount airfare websites to build an accurate budget , which also included regular expenses we d still need to cover , like student loans and insurance .
Fortunately , I was no stranger to squirreling away money -- I started at 17 , diligently saving money from after - school jobs .
By 21 , I d saved $ 38,000 , which I used to buy my house outright . (
Yes , you read that right .
I snatched up a small , very affordable home at the housing markets lowpoint . )
This meant we did nt have a mortgage to worry about .
Aside from a modest personal loan , we had no debt and an emergency fund , plus our monthly expenses were usually only around $ 1,800 .
We did our homework , and learned that our money would go furthest in Eastern Europe -- its cheaper and we had relatives to crash with -- so we planned on staying there for several months and cutting our travels shorter in more expensive destinations . (
We stayed in Paris for three weeks , by comparison . )
We estimated our adventure would cost at least $ 25,000 .
Hustling to hit our target in under a year Hitting our goal hinged on two things : upping our income and reducing expenses .
Immediately , we found side gigs that brought in an extra $ 1,000 a month : I drove for Uber and Lyft ; Vanessa worked at a bridal salon and did wedding videography on the weekends .
Working extra hours required stamina , but we looked at it as a temporary sacrifice to get us to Europe faster .
We also revamped our budget , spending less on food , canceling our gym memberships and Amazon Prime and embracing a zero - spend Christmas -- saving about $ 500 a month .
Before long , we were socking away between $ 2,700 and $ 3,000 a month .
We even had enough , on top of that , to cover our airfare ahead of the trip and top off our emergency fund .
We crossed the finish line a few months later -- saving a total of $ 27,000 in 10 months time .
Another bright spot : We found a renter , which secured an extra $ 1,000 of monthly income while we traveled .
In April 2016 , we quit our jobs , and boarded a flight .
Our incredible year abroad We began with three months in Italy before heading to Romania , my parents homeland , where I got to spend time with family I d never known .
We spent a total of 11 months traveling everywhere from Croatia to Germany and Switzerland , ringing in Christmas in France .
We traveled at our own pace and immersed ourselves in the different cultures .
But make no mistake , we were budget travelers .
We booked Airbnbs , used a debit card without international fees and were choosy with our itinerary .
In pricier locales like London , for example , we skipped tour buses and walked instead ( a great way to see a city ) .
But overall , our tight - ish budget did nt hold us back .
We actually came home with a few hundred left , and quickly locked down new jobs without having to dip into our emergency fund .
On top of an amazing experience , our year abroad really boosted my financial confidence .
If we could save up that kind of money in such a short amount time , what else is possible ?
I ca nt wait to find out .
Were currently looking into new ways of creating passive income -- from rental properties to growing my personal finance vlog -- to fund our future travels .
Our increasingly complicated world makes childhood more stressful and worry - filled .
Gaining insight into how youngsters feel as their cocoons are invaded by anxiety and fear - and what can be done to help them - is tremendously valuable . "
Little Panic : Dispatches From an Anxious Life " ( Grand Central , 385 pp . ,
out of four ) tries to do that .
The book offers a glimpse into the maelstrom churning in the mind of Amanda Stern , who shares in - depth recollections of her childhood .
The memoirist grew up in New York City 's Greenwich Village in the 1970s and ' 80s , presumably with all the makings of a smooth - sailing life .
But starting from early childhood , she was wracked with an all - consuming sense of worry and dread .
It took years to diagnose Stern , who also suffered from having a checked - out dad and a clueless mother .
Many chapters begin with excerpts from the author 's psychological and school evaluations over the years .
Stern tries to convey how wracked she was with nervousness , uncertainty and fear ; for example , she was convinced her mother would die or move away .
To prevent that from happening , the then - elementary - school - age Stern believed she had to keep a watchful eye on her mom .
Her worry reached a fever pitch after 6-year - old Etan Patz vanished in 1979 .
He was a neighborhood boy whom Stern ( who was then 9 ) did n't know , but whose disappearance is credited with bringing national awareness to the plight of missing children .
She became so obsessed with the case that once she called a police officer over , thinking she 'd found Etan - until the cop pointed out that the child she 'd found was Chinese .
Interspersed among these more bitter - than - sweet chapters are snapshots of Stern 's life as an adult , including tales of a failed relationship with a long - term , loser boyfriend , and the grief that comes from the sale of one 's childhood home .
The problem is that unlike many other autobiographies , there are no universal lessons in " Little Panic . "
It reads like an incessant whine .
And the whole time , the reader thinks , " Wow , these parents are lousy . "
Also detracting from the kvetchy autobiography is Stern 's voice as a writer .
In memories from her childhood , Stern writes with a erudite elegance that a kid simply would n't have - even one who grew up in a sophisticated household and attended private school . "
One day I 'll have to live on the street side of life .
On the garden side we look after one another ... If only this were the entire world .
If only the garden could hold us all " ?
No young child thinks like that . "
The night is fast - forwarding its heaviness and I feel it coming for me " ?
Please .
While sporadic bursts of beauty in Stern 's writing - " a growing constellation of errors , " for example - prevent " Little Panic " from being unbearable , the uneven narrative tone and crass piggybacking on the Patz family 's tragedy make this collection of dispatches to skip .

The 4 percent unemployment rate in the U.S. has depleted the pool of available workers across the country , making it harder for companies of all sizes to find job candidates .
But the market is especially brutal for businesses with fewer than 50 workers , which ca nt offer the pay and benefits of larger firms .
That s taking a toll on the smaller enterprises , which often ca nt meet all of the demand from customers in a revved - up economy that s projected to grow nearly 3 percent this year . "
The big guys " are struggling to hire as well . "
But they re winning , " says Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moodys Analytics , which helps payroll processor ADP compile its monthly private - sector employment report .

More telling , small - business employment grew less than 1 percent annually for the first time since 2011 .
Thirty - six percent of small - business owners had job openings they could nt fill in June , matching the record high set in November 2000 , according to the National Federation of Independent Businesss monthly survey out this week . "
When unemployment is low , small businesses are nt able to hire " as many workers as their larger rivals , says IHS Markit economist Jim Diffley .
He says smaller firms have long grappled with that disadvantage in booming economies .
In response , they re raising wages more briskly .
Pay at businesses with fewer than 50 workers rose 3.3 percent annually last month , ADP data show , the fastest among companies based on size .
Yet most still ca nt keep pace with larger companies .
Rauen says Envision instead offers less tangible perks , such as extra time off for childrens activities and other events , and the freedom to veer at times from a 9-to-5 work schedule . "
People do nt like that big company feel , " he says .
Envision , which now has three job openings , is also more actively using social media to reveal its behind - the - scenes production techniques and attract job candidates , participating in community events and emphasizing its work with local charities . "
Were making a difference , " Rauen says , a selling point that particularly appeals to millennial job prospects .
He also touts that customer service reps do n't just sit at a desk - they work at a store , and juggle email and calls .
The strategies are helping , but its still taking Envision at least three times as long to fill job openings as it did a year ago .
Sales are up about 20 percent in 2018 , Rauen says , but that s below the 25 percent to 30 percent growth pace of recent years because he ca nt hire fast enough to meet demand .
In Atlanta , Ankit Patel , CEO of Classic Vision Care , says larger opticians such as LensCrafters and MyEyeDr are picking off job candidates before they even come in for scheduled interviews .
Its taking Patel about two months to fill job openings , up from a couple of weeks .
Classic , with 17 employees at four area locations , has raised opticians hourly pay from $ 13 to about $ 17 the past year , but the large chains are still paying a dollar or two more .
So for the first time , the 6-year - old business is hiring inexperienced workers to be front - desk receptionists and training them to handle sales and assist with eye exams .
New hires typically perform all those tasks right away .
Alfredo Ortiz , CEO of the Job Creators Network , which mostly serves small businesses , says they should be able to better compete with larger companies for workers under a new federal rule announced last month that allows them to band together to offer affordable health coverage .
10Xfive , an Atlanta digital marketing company with 35 employees , is taking a more aggressive approach .
CEO Jon Ostenson says he s offering a $ 10,000 referral fee to employees or others who deliver him a business development manager who takes the job and closes three deals .
Hell likely pay about $ 5,000 for digital marketing specialists , he says . "
It just widens the network , " Ostenson says . "
If you say $ 2,000 , it does nt really get their attention . "
Over the years , communications marketing group Edelman has received takeover offers from other companies .
Yet despite the allure of a potential merger or acquisition , the global firm has chosen to stay independent -- a decision that its CEO considers a wise move . "
The best thing [ we did ] is not to sell out to one of the big advertising holding companies , because we were able to diversify , and also hang on during recessions and not make any money , and invest in the next leg of growth , " Richard Edelman , president and CEO of Edelman , told CNBCs Karen Tso on an episode of " What Drives You . "
In 1952 , a few years before Richard was born , the public relations firm that he now heads was launched in Chicago by his father Daniel Edelman .
Fast - forward to 2018 and the group remains an independent , family - owned business that has collaborated with a whole host of companies including LEGO , Unilever , Heineken and Dove .
In fact , it was a world that Richard was immersed into from a very young age .
Speaking to CNBC at this years Cannes Lions festival in the south of France , Edelman said that his father " was nt shy about bringing clients home , " giving Richard the opportunity to meet the likes of Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders and Orville Redenbacher , famous for his eponymous popcorn brand .
Over the years , my caricatures of Donald Trump have evolved but not as much as my opinion of him .
When Trump announced he was running for president , I admit that I did n't take this millionaire , hotel magnate , reality TV show celebrity as a serious candidate .
I doubted his ability to do the job .
So I drew him as a clown .
In fact , my cartoons were as critical of him as many of my liberal cartoonist friends .
Then Trump started a war with the news media , tagging major news outlets as " fake news . "
Ahem , I 'm in the media .
And while Trump promised to pursue conservative policies , this conservative cartoonist doubted his sincerity .
After all , it was nt that long ago that he was on the left .
In the crowded primary field , Trump got the most attention by being the loudest .
His tweets could not be ignored by the media and resulted in Trump dominating news coverage .
I found his personal attacks sophomoric .
I mean , calling his opponents " Low - energy Jeb , " " Lyin Ted , " " Little Marco , " " Crazy Bernie " and " Crooked Hillary " was not presidential .
It was childish , but it worked .
He won and they lost .
More : The Democratic Party left me behind -- and I 'm not alone White evangelicals fear the future and yearn for the past .
Of course Trump is their hero .
This conservative is siding with the liberal in the Jimmy Kimmel - Sean Hannity feud In this braggadocios " I m the greatest " culture , Trump became the Muhammad Ali of politicians .
His claims of , " I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created , " " I m really rich , " " I m very highly educated , " " I m the best ( fill in the blank ) " stretched credulity but was certainly entertaining .
In one of the debates , Trump admitted that he was an entertainer but said that he was more than an entertainer , that he was " a businessman , and that 's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back . "
Soon his rallies were filled with people who believed that he was the real hope and change America needed .
In 1992 , millionaire businessman Ross Perot said that the country needed to be run like a business .
He was great at listing the countrys problems , but he did nt communicate how he would fix them .
Trump identified the problems and fixes .
His political promises were simple , repeated often and easily remembered -- build the wall , repeal and replace Obamacare , cut taxes , destroy the Islamic State group , renegotiate better trade deals and make America great again .
So how in the world did Trump change my mind ?
He started keeping those promises .
Trump is delivering on his promises First , he picked Mike Pence as his running mate .
As I ve written before , I ve known Pence for over 20 years and he has the conservative bona fides .
So , of course , I supported this decision .
Then , after taking office , Trump began to reverse President Barack Obama 's executive orders and burdensome regulations on businesses .
He approved the Keystone XL pipeline .
He cut taxes and the economy picked up steam .
Again , I supported these decisions .
Sure , he failed to repeal Obamacare , but its individual mandate was repealed in the tax - cut bill .
As a Christian , I have been accused of hypocrisy and my faith has been questioned for not condemning Trump 's past extramarital affairs , his language and treatment of women .
Look , I know he is a deeply flawed man .
So am I. The Bible says we all are .
But evangelicals believe in grace and forgiveness and are commanded to pray for our leaders .
So I support him in prayer .
Trump has proven to be pro - religious liberty , pro - life and pro - Israel .
He moved the American embassy to Jerusalem , pulled out of the Paris climate agreement and the Trans - Pacific Partnership , and began negotiations to denuclearize North Korea .
I support all of these policies .
There have been a few hiccups .
Trump signed a budget bill that increased the national debt , which is now over $ 21 trillion .
The Russia probe is still a cloud over his administration , and I do n't like trade wars .
But heres the dominating reason I ve changed my mind about Trump 's ability to lead : judges .
I support his picks of Justice Neil Gorsuch , his new U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the host of conservative federal judges that Trump has gotten confirmed .
I shudder to think of the activist judges that a President Hillary Clinton would have picked .
In my opinion , Trump has had the most successful 18 months as president than any other I 've ever drawn .
So yes , I support his presidency .
I admit that I was wrong about Trump .
He 's not a clown .
He 's a businessman , entertainer , and now the president that I did n't want but now think we need .

All could get pricier under new tariffs threatened by President Trump , which would effectively tax those goods -- and thousands more -- as they arrive in the U.S. from China .
Trump claims China already uses " harmful industrial policies " that make the tariffs payback for unfair practices .
China , which says Trump 's ignoring well - established trade rules , could hit back with its own levies ( again ) .
Republicans and Democrats alike thumbs - downed the tariffs list that dropped Tuesday , as did U.S. business owners who expect to be hurt by them .

Getting negative at NATO Ah , NATO .
A group of friendly allied nations committed to one another since World War II .
Let 's see how their chummy summit opened in Brussels : " Germany is totally controlled by Russia , " Trump said at the summit 's start on Wednesday .
That 's extraordinary rhetoric , aimed in this case at Germany 's support for a Russian natural gas project that would put a pipeline through Europe . "
Germany , as far as I m concerned , is captive to Russia , " said Trump , who himself plans to meet privately with Russia 's Vladimir Putin next week .
But after facing German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday , Trump seemed to change his tone . "
We have a tremendous relationship with Germany , " he said .
Punishment for the White House ?
Maaaaybe A judge set deadlines for the Trump administration to reunite the families split up under the president 's " zero tolerance " immigration policy .
So what happens if they do n't hit 'em ? (
Spoiler : They probably wo n't . )
Lower - ranking members of federal agencies could face jail time , or agency heads could receive public shaming in court -- both of which could delayed by appeals .
Or the judge could fine the executive branch and put the money toward aiding separated families .
But legal experts told us all those options , thanks to questions of legality and longstanding tradition , seem unlikely .

Packaging giant Tetra Pak now obtains 50 percent of its global electricity supply from renewable sources , the business said Tuesday .
The landmark figure comes as the business works towards a goal of using 100 percent renewable electricity across all of its global operations by 2030 .
Tetra Pak said its renewable electricity use had grown from 20 percent in 2016 to 50 percent today .
The rise is a result of several factors , such as solar power installations at its facilities and the purchase of International Renewable Energy Certificates , or I - RECs .
A renewable energy certificate is important because , as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency puts it , they " substantiate renewable electricity use claims . " "
Using renewable energy is an important part of our journey to reduce the carbon impact of our own operations and so help tackle climate change , " Mario Abreu , Tetra Paks vice president of sustainability , said in a statement . "
Through the purchase of renewable energy certificates , we are investing in the development of infrastructure to increase the availability of renewable electricity , " he added . "
Meanwhile , we are also exploring opportunities to scale up our own on - site solar power installations . "
Tetra Pak is among a number of global businesses looking to embrace renewable energy .
Last October , for example , Amazon announced that its biggest wind farm to date was operational .
The business said that Amazon Wind Farm Texas , which is located in Scurry County , would add over 1 million megawatt hours of clean energy to the grid annually .
Tetra Pak is also a member of the RE100 , a global initiative made up of some of the world 's biggest companies , all committed to 100 percent renewable power .
Other members of the RE100 include Ikea , Facebook and Mars .
PALM SPRINGS , Calif. - Nicholas Hughes used to sell a cannabis treat fit for a king : The Elvis , a chocolate cookie infused with 1,000 milligrams of mind - altering THC - 100 times what is now the per - serving dosage limit in California . "
You could not keep them on the shelf , " he said .
But earlier this month , Hughes ' dispensary , Cathedral City Care Collective North , parted ways with the cookie , one of tons of cannabis products that ca n't be sold since California phased in new testing , packaging and dosing standards on July 1 .
For edibles like the Elvis , the state now imposes a limit of 10 milligrams of THC per serving and 100 milligrams of THC per package .
More : Canada 's legal weed not welcome in US More : Recreational marijuana now legal in Vermont Marijuana companies in California had a six - month grace period to sell weed harvested or processed before 2018 .
With the cut - off date looming on July 1 , retailers hustled to sell old cannabis at fire sale prices , then swept the leftovers off their shelves and dumped them in the trash .
Now the companies face another challenge : restocking .
But with increased demand for compliance tests causing a bottleneck at labs , dispensaries that used to fill every inch of their display cases now fear a supply shortage . "
We probably have a quarter of what we usually have , " Hughes said .
Other retailers have seen their product variety shrink as much as 90 percent . "
I m getting pictures every day of retailers that went from 45 strains to five , " said Jerred Kiloh , president of the United Cannabis Business Association .
The transition to stricter testing has been a bonanza for cannabis testing laboratories .
Greg Magdoff , the founder of PharmLabs Cannabis Testing , said desperate dispensary owners have called him , " crying on the phone like , ' Dude , help , I ca nt fill my shelves . "
Other calls come from panicked lab customers demanding faster processing times . "
Lots of people are scrambling , " said Josh Swider , co - owner of San Diego - based Infinite Chemical Analysis Labs . "
They re calling me every 10 minutes saying , ' Where s my sample ?
Where s my sample ? "
The bottleneck could belie an imbalance in the legal cannabis market .
While 599 temporary manufacturing licenses and 3,105 temporary cultivation licenses are active in California , the state has only granted 31 temporary licenses for labs .
Confronted with rising demand after July 1 , lab managers have spent the past three weeks staffing up , only to find their turnaround times are still double or triple what they were before the new regulations . "
Every lab is backlogged , " Swider said . "
There s only so fast we can run . "
When the states testing rules are in full effect at the end of this year , California labs will have to test for 66 residual pesticides , 20 residual solvents and processing chemicals , four heavy metals and three kinds of microbes - not to mention water and moisture as well as the chemicals that give cannabis its smell , taste and psychoactive properties and contaminants like dirt , mold and rodent hair .
Labs are also charged with measuring homogeneity - that is , whether the same concentration of THC is contained in each serving of an edible .
The samples do nt always pass .
At different labs , pesticides , incorrect labeling and lack of homogeneity were all cited as causes of failure .
Swider estimates as much as half of marijuana flower and 90 percent of marijuana distillates in Southern California wo nt pass the compliance tests implemented July 1 .
Even companies diligent about compliance might not make the cut .
Swider recalls one customer failed a test because it used an organic tangerine tincture that turned out to contain pesticides . "
You ve got to source all clean product , " Swider said .
Lab managers say state testing thresholds are so strict , their businesses have to use cutting - edge equipment to catch tiny concentrations of contaminants .
And once a problem is detected , diagnosing its source might not be easy .
Magdoff , whose company has three labs in California , said some air filtration systems fail to catch contaminants , for example , especially in windy places like the Coachella Valley . "
The wind is ridiculous , " he said . "
All the sand and all the dirt from all the fields - there s pesticides in there .
All the cattle - you ve got E. coli and all these bacteria and microbes . "
Packaging and labeling is another challenge .
At CW Analytical , an Oakland laboratory , CEO Robert Martin said a big challenge for his customers has been making sure the amounts of CBD and THC in their products match the numbers on their labels , within certain bounds .
Martin said about 10 percent of samples fail , the vast majority because the THC claim made on their labels does nt match the labs analysis . "
Its really hard to have these really top notch regulations on an industry that is struggling to get to the level we want it to be at , " Martin said .
But Martin has misgivings about his labs role in enforcing label claims , a time - consuming function he thinks should be the states responsibility . "
We ve become an agent of the state , essentially , " he said . "
I m uncomfortable with that .
I ve become a cop all of a sudden . "
Tom Adams , managing director of cannabis industry research firm BDS Analytics , said the lesson to other states rolling out a legal marijuana market is simple : relax . "
This is not heroin , you know ? "
he said . "
To respond to cannabis 's misguided inclusion in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act for the past 50 years by over - regulating and over - taxing it is an enormous mistake if the goal is to legalize a largely illicit business . "
Adams thinks tight regulations make it harder for legal businesses to compete with the black market .
But no matter what states do to legalize cannabis , he said , bumps in the road are inevitable . "
Is there a way out ? "
he said . "
I do nt think there is . "

Passengers will no longer get peanuts on Southwest Airlines flights , starting this summer .
Beginning Aug. 1 , the low - cost airline will stop serving peanuts on board its planes , the carrier said on Monday .
The airline is one of several large carriers that have ditched the longtime , packaged airplane snack as some passengers suffer from peanut allergies , which can cause severe and even life - threatening reactions . "
Peanuts forever will be part of Southwests history and DNA , " the airline said in a statement . "
However , to ensure the best on - board experience for everyone , especially for customers with peanut - related allergies , we ve made the difficult decision to discontinue serving peanuts on all flights beginning Aug. 1 . "
Severe allergic reactions to food are the cause of 150 deaths a year in the United States and 2,000 hospitalizations , according to the Food and Drug Administration .
The airline said it will continue to serve complementary pretzels and other snacks on longer routes , which it hopes " will please customers who might be nostalgic or sad to see peanuts go .
Our ultimate goal is to create an environment where all customers -- including those with peanut - related allergies -- feel safe and welcome on every Southwest flight . "
American and United do n't serve packaged peanuts on board but they warn passengers that other foods and snacks they serve can contain nuts or other foods to which some passengers may be allergic .
The airlines ca n't guarantee the flight will be entirely free of peanuts .
Delta Air Lines on its website said that it wo n't serve peanuts on board if a passenger notifies the airline of an allergy .
It also allows travelers to board early to clean seats and tray tables for trace amounts of the food .
Southwest , too , said customers should note their peanut allergy when booking flights and that they can still board early to wipe down seats and tray tables .
Patrick Kaser , managing director and portfolio manager at Brandywine Global , believes free cash flow is a key determining factor in whether or not a company will be a lucrative investment .
Earnings , however , are not always indicative of a successful company . "
There are many ways to manipulate earnings , earnings per share , GAAP , non - GAAP , but there 's very few ways to maniupulate free cash flow , " said Kaser , who heads the fundamental equity team and is the lead portfolio manager on the classic large - cap value strategy . "
So if we see a company with free cash flow , that 's usually a good starting point to finding a good investment , " he said .
Cash flow is the net amount of money being put into and out of a company .
Businesses can manipulate net income by excluding stock option expenses , demanding a one - time restructuring fee that becomes cyclical and companies can classify expenses differently , among other methods .
Free cash flow is net income minus capital expenditures , so basically what 's left over to spend on growing the business or returning money to shareholders .
This money can be used for acquisitions , paying off debt or reinvestment .

The second half of 2018 will be tough for investors as they grapple with rising trade tensions and higher interest rates , according to Goldman Sachs .
However , companies with strong balance sheets like Facebook and NVIDIA should do well in the tough times ahead as they can better deal with higher borrowing costs and overall volatility .
Equities posted a mixed performance to start off the year , as the enthusiasm over strong economic data and solid earnings growth was dampened by worries about an impending trade war between the U.S. and its key partners .
This , along with the prospects of higher rates , sets up investors for a potentially rough second half . "

The Dow declined 1.8 percent in the first six months of the year , while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 rose 8.8 percent and 1.7 percent , respectively .

The company added that details will be made " as and when appropriate . "
Chinese internet giant Tencent said it plans to spin off its streaming music service on a U.S. stock exchange .
The proposed listing can be read as a sign that the music industry is getting back on track , as more listeners take to streaming music through smartphone apps even as companies battle piracy and try to sign up more paying customers .
Tencent 's major rival in music streaming , Spotify , debuted its own shares in April , structuring its listing to allow existing investors to sell directly to the public .

Tencent Music is seeking an initial public offering worth up to $ 4 billion , valuing it at about $ 25 billion , IFR reported in April , citing people familiar with the plans .

Personal computer shipments increased for the first time in six years in the second quarter of 2018 , research firm Gartner said Thursday afternoon .
Gartner said that overall shipments grew 1.4 % from the same quarter the year before , the first time Gartner has tracked a year - over - year gain since the first quarter of 2012 .
Gartner rival IDC has reported year - over - year gains for the sector in that time , but counts more form factors than Gartner , most notably Chromebooks , web - based laptops with Alphabet Inc. GOOGL , -0.60 % GOOG , -0.59 % software .
Gartner noted that gains were largely focused on sales to large businesses that are upgrading to computers with Microsoft Corp. 's MSFT , -0.15 % Windows 10 software .
According to Gartner , Lenovo Group Ltd. 992 , -2.59 % shipped slightly more PCs than HP Inc. HPQ , +3.34 % in the period , after HP took the top spot back from Lenovo last year .
Dell Technologies Inc. , Apple Inc. AAPL , -0.32 % and Acer Group followed , in that order , and all five PC manufacturers showed year - over - year growth .
Pfizer postponed drug price hikes after President Donald Trump ripped the company and threatened retaliation .
The pharmaceutical giant confirmed Tuesday that it " will defer the company 's price increases " for now .
The company 's response came after CEO Ian Read had " an extensive discussion " with Trump on Tuesday .
After the call , Trump hailed the concession . "
Pfizer is rolling back price hikes , so American patients do nt pay more , " he wrote on Twitter . "
We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same .
Great news for the American people ! "
To be sure , the price increases were not canceled altogether .
Pfizer said it would reimpose the increases no later than Jan. 1 .
They could return earlier if Trump 's " blueprint " on drug prices takes effect before then , Pfizer said .

The company had also lowered some prices , and those decreases will stay in effect . "
Pfizer shares the Presidents concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need , " Read said in a statement .
In a tweet Monday , Trump had said : " Pfizer & others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason .
They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves , while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere .
We will respond ! "
Trump 's criticism of Pfizer 's price hikes followed similar missives on the subject in the past .
Washington lawmakers and regulators have long bemoaned pharmaceutical prices , but there 's no indication of any significant pending policy action aimed at regulating prices , bolstering competition or some other potential solution .
Trump has repeatedly promised to lower drug prices in the past . "
We will have tougher negotiation , more competition and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter , " Trump said in a Rose Garden address in May. " And it will start to take effect very soon . "
At the time , his administration issued a 44-page blueprint detailing his strategy .
But critics said it lacked aggressive maneuvers required to curtail prices , such as potentially allowing Medicare to use its purchasing power to negotiate directly with drug companies .

Philadelphia church saves souls through sports About a dozen years ago , a Philadelphia church thought athletics could be a form of outreach to young people .
They had no idea how successful their effort would be .
James Brown reports .
Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Thursday he still favors only one more interest - rate hike this year even with fresh data released showing consumer price inflation rising at fastest pace in six years .
In an interview with Bloomberg Television , Harker said he was open to supporting two interest - rate hikes this year , but only if inflation accelerates further .
Consumer prices rose to a 12-month pace of 2.9 % in June , the highest level since February 2012 .
The core rate edged up a more modest 2.3 % .
Read : Consumer inflation hits 6-year high , CPI shows " Right now , I think we should take this slow and steady , " Harker said .
If core inflation is " starting to accelerate past 2.5 % , then I do think we have to act , " he said . "
Absent that , I think there are lots of good reasons to hold off , " he added .
Harker , who is not a voting member of the Fed interest - rate committee this year , said he is " starting to see dynamics in the market that do make you think that inflation will accelerate , but I think I d like to see a little more evidence " before he would support two more moves this year .
The Fed has already hiked interest - rates twice this year .
The latest Fed " dot plot " from its meeting last month shows the Fed is divided over how many more time to raise rates this year .
Eight Fed officials penciled in two or more interest - rate hikes this year while seven projected one or none .

Her involvement is really key to growth and success as we move forward , and we 're excited for her to be on board , " Barone said . "
She 'll really be providing insight as an incredibly successful business woman ... We 're looking forward to all she will bring to our team . "
Fox and Dr. Andrew Weil , pioneer of the Anti - Inflammatory Diet , launched True Food Kitchen in 2008 , helping propel healthy eating into the mainstream .
Last October , True Food Kitchen became into its company with Centerbridge Partners as majority owners .
The newest locations in Nashville and Jacksonville are opening later this year .
Fox Restaurant Concepts hired Barone , a former Starbucks executive , in 2016 to lead the transition .
Winfrey 's announcement coincides with the launch of True Food 's summer menu .
Dishes include a Korean noodle salad , parfait made with summer berries , responsibly sourced striped sea bass , watermelon mojito and lavender coconut cold brew .

HSAs , which pair with high - deductible health insurance plans , offer savers a way to put away money on a tax - deductible or pre - tax basis .
Contributions then grow on a tax - free basis , and account holders can take distributions to cover qualified medical expenses .
Though the tax benefits of HSAs are universal , the accounts themselves will vary from one provider to the next , particularly when it comes to the fees investors must pay .
Its fairly common to have low balances , so fees do play a role .
Patrick Amey certified financial planner , KHC Wealth Management " The thing with HSAs is that there are several fees to take into consideration , " said Leo Acheson , associate director of multiasset and alternative strategies at Morningstar .
This is especially true for investors who want to shop HSA providers after parting with an employer . "
A lot of the banks I ve seen charge the highest platform fees -- $ 50 or $ 100 a year to have the account and they re using A - share mutual funds [ which charge an upfront fee to investors at purchase ] , " said Stephen Jordan , a certified financial planner with Cyr|Woertz Financial Group in Peoria , Ill. " That s never a good option for a small amount of money when you re trying to create growth ; you re throwing money out the window , " he said .
Heres what you need to know about the different fees in your HSA .
Two components Hero Images | Getty Images Your HSA will be assessed based on two components : Fees taken out by the provider and investment expenses , according to Devenir , an HSA consultancy .
Those " provider fees " include account maintenance costs , which may be assessed on a monthly basis and could be waived if an account holders balance crosses a particular threshold , which can range from $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 , Morningstar found .
These expenses can sap the account if a saver merely stashes the HSA in the providers checking account and uses it concurrently for medical expenses , instead of allowing it to accumulate . "
Its fairly common to have low balances , so fees do play a role , " said Patrick Amey , a certified financial planner at KHC Wealth Management in Overland Park , Kansas . "
Were looking for an account where the fees are reasonable and you get good value , " he said .
A saver who has contributed $ 2,000 for the year , spends half of that balance on qualified medical costs and pays $ 4.50 each month for maintenance fees will have lost more than 5 percent of his year - end balance due to these monthly fees , according to Morningstar .
Investment costs Savers who are intent on storing their HSA funds for long - term use -- perhaps holding off on spending the money until they ve retired -- need to consider the investment fee providers charge as well as the cost of the underlying funds they select .
See below for Morningstars breakdown of total expense ratios based on an investment of $ 15,000 .
Note : SelectAccount is now known as Further .
How providers levy these expenses will vary . "
Some plans have no dollar - based investment fee , but they re using A - share mutual funds in their plan and that s how they get paid , " said Acheson of Morningstar . "
Others have cheap funds in their plans -- such as institutional share classes -- but they layer on a dollar - based investment fee , " he said .

Pizza is n't just fun and delicious ; it 's a multibillion - dollar economy .
According to PMQ Pizza Magazine , the U.S. pizza market is a $ 44 billion industry and consumer demand is on the rise .
Three cities , Chicago , New York City and Los Angeles , are consistently considered among the best pizza cities in the U.S. , top ranked by the likes of The Daily Meal , Travel + Leisure and Tasting Table .
CNBC Make It spoke to a pizza expert in each city to find the best pizza in America 's top pizza locales .
Chicago Chicago is the best pizza city in America , according to TripAdvisor .
Pizza history goes as far back as the early 1900s with immigrants coming in from Europe .
It was n't until 1943 when deep - dish pizza was invented , and Chicago has been known for it since .
Visitors can take pizza tours , including those with pizza expert Steve Dolinsky , host of ABC 7 Chicago 's " The Hungry Hound , " a 13-time James Beard Award - winning food reporter and author of " Pizza City USA : 101 Reasons Why Chicago is America'a Greatest Pizza Town . "
Dolinsky tells CNBC Make It there are around 9,000 pizza places in Chicago , but these three top the list .
Pat 's Pizza and Ristorante " Pat 's has been around since 1950 .
It is an institution , " says Dolinsky , and unlike some Chicago joints , the pizza here is loved for its thin crust . "
You can tell immediately how thin it is .
Almost caramelized on the edge , the pizza is nicely browned . "
You can actually hear when you bite into the crust , " says Dolinsky , describing its perfect crunchiness . "
It 's not a slice joint , it 's a classic Chicago - style tavern , so it 's square cut ( a.k.a . , '
party cut ' ) , " he says .
And since it 's located in the Lake View neighborhood of the city , there are not long lines . "
Only locals really know about Pat 's , " says Dolinsky .
A build - it - yourself whole pizza starts at $ 13.25 .
Pizzeria Bebu Pizzeria Bebu does n't look like much from the outside .
The year - old restaurant is tucked into a long , narrow room at the base of a micro - apartment building with floor - to - ceiling windows in Lincoln Park .
But owner Zach Smith is trying to change your idea of what a pizza joint should be , according to Dolinsky .
There are wines by the bottle ( from $ 30 to $ 200 ) and the pizza is " artisan . " "
An artisan pie is typically made by a chef with more experience than just slinging average pies that were run through a sheeter , " says Dolinsky . "
These doughs are composed of a blend of flours and ... have a higher moisture content , which allows for steaming inside the dough and the creation of more air pockets , which result in better chew and texture .... The toppings are always sourced meticulously or made in - house .
Bebu makes all of their sausage and meatballs for their pizzas in - house , " he says .
A slice at Bebu in Chicago Pizza City USA Despite the fancy pizza - making , Dolinsky says the service is casual and " chill . "
Whole pies start at $ 18 .
The Pepperoni pizza with parmesan , mozzarella , garlic , calabrian chile and basil is $ 19 .
Dante 's Dante 's has a " grungy " attitude , says Dolinsky , with rock and roll music playing ( often metal ) .
All of the pies are " Dante 's Inferno"-themed , like the Virgil pie ( black olive , green olive , salami and fresh mozarella ) , named after Dante 's guide through through hell , and a 9 Levels of Hell pie , with chilies , meats , peppers and more .
You can get 20-inch specialty pies , but the real attraction are the gigantic , " Fred Flinstone - sized slices , " says Dolinsky . "
We are not a slice culture , but we have some places making excellent slices . "
Despite the in - your - face feel of the place , Dante 's does n't neglect the details .
The crust of the pizza is brushed with garlic butter and sprinkled with parmesan , reggiano and oregano , " so you get a bonus breadstick - like flavor in your final few bites , " says Dolinsky . "
No one else in Chicago does this . "
Slices start at $ 3.50 .
Labriola " Sit at a table during lunch on any given day , and I 'll bet 80 percent of the tables are ordering a deep - dish pie , " says Dolinsky of Labriola . "
Generous , chunky icebergs of fresh tomato lightly seasoned with fresh herbs grace the pizza ; juicy , jagged - edged pieces of sausage ( seasoned with a bit of Calabrian chile from Calabria , Italy ) nestle within melted mozzarella , " says Dolinsky describing the pie . "
And the best surprise of all , the dough is firm to the touch and crispy all the way around .
A perfect ratio ! "
The chefs here have cracked the code here , according to Dolinsky : " They offer deep - dish pizza that both tourists and picky locals like me actually crave . "
Depending on time of day , there can be lines .
A 12-inch deep - dish pie is between $ 21.25 and $ 30.25 .
The signature Danny 's Special , with tomato , mozzarella , sausage , mushroom , green pepper and onions , is $ 28.25 .
New York City New York City is world - famous for it 's pizza -- many say the secret is in the water .
New Yorker Nino Coniglio , owner and pizza maker at Williamsburg Pizza and The Woodstock , has been awarded World Champion Pizza Maker 10 times at The International Pizza Expo , among many other distinctions .
These are his top pizza picks in New York City .
PQR PQR stands for " Pizza Quadrata Romana , " and it serves the best Roman - style ( square ) pizza in N.Y.C. from a true master , Angelo Lezzi , according to Coniglio . "
Angelo is truly the godfather of Roman - style pizza in Rome herself .
No one really knows of him in America , but he holds the gold standard in Italy and teaches everyone else how to do Roman - style properly , " says Coniglio . "
He 's known for this high - hydration style of pizza - making with long fermentation that makes for super airy and crispy crust . "
PQR opened in March 2018 , and it 's a " teeny , tiny shop " on the Upper East Side of Manhattan . "
Roman - style pizza is by no means a modern concept , but it feels like it here .
It 's not really a place that you could just stumble upon , you 'd have to be looking for it .
It 's a pricey slice , but absolutely worth it . "
A marina slice with tomato sauce , garlic and oregano starts at $ 4 ; " Rucola , pomodoro and porchetta " with mozzarella , arugula , cherry tomatoes and porchetta is $ 9 a slice .
Prince Street Pizza Sicilian pizza is a thick - crust pizza , often rectangular , that originated in Sicily ; Prince Street Pizza has the best Sicilian pizza in the city , according to Coniglio .
Located in the NoLita neighborhood of Manhattan , it has one of the most recognizable slices around , the " Spicy Spring Pie . "
It 's all over foodie social media , for example . "
You know , that one covered in small , thick - cut pepperoni ?
Honestly , no one knows how it got to be so famous , but it 's just that good that they did n't need any help , " says Coniglio .
The shop took over the space where the oldest Ray 's Pizza -- another iconic New York City pizza brand -- once lived , and new owner Frank Morano " wanted to carry on the original legacy , " Coniglio says .
Murano tested dough for months until he achieved that perfect " upside down " square , which he remembered from eating at Ray 's Pizza as a kid , explains Coniglio . "
Everyone loves the pepperoni , but my favorite is that upside down slice , the ' Prince Perfection ' with mozzarella on the bottom and this secret , tangy sauce on top , " he says .
The original slice with marinara and mozzarella is $ 2.95 ; the Spicy Spring Pie is $ 3.50 .
Keste Keste is one of the best spots to get wood - fired Neapolitan pizzas , says Coniglio . "
There are a couple of locations , but the Fulton [ Street location in Manhattan ] has a pizza school ; I teach " Pizza Americana " classes there . " "
N.Y.C. is home to ' New York pizza ' for sure , but within the last couple of decades it has become home to all pizzas , " says Coniglio . "
Keste is where you go to be transported back to Naples .
It 's an experience here , you do n't come to Keste to chow down on a slice and move on .
You sit , have a good glass of wine and enjoy yourself . "
There are about 50 different pizzas offered here , like ricotta with tomato sauce , fresh mozzarella , fresh ricotta , " grana , " basil and extra virgin olive oil ( $ 17 ) , and Kale with black cabbage and smoked mozzarella ( $ 16 ) . "
Caporuscio uses this crazy flour called Caputo that is a modern interpretation of the type of milling process from the 19th century , " says Coniglio . "
The resulting cooked dough is very digestible , still soft but it 's not soaking wet like some Neapolitan pies can be .
It makes for a much more enjoyable experience . "
Alain Ducasse , a celebrity and renowned chef , told Bloomberg his favorite pizza was Keste .
Whole pies are between $ 10 and $ 20 .
A signature pizza with lightly fried pizza dough topped with cream of pork onions , " parmigiano reggiano " and finished in a wood - fired oven is $ 16 .
Una Pizza Napoletana True Neapolitan pizza is rooted in history and must be made in a very specific way -- with San Marzano tomatoes from Mount Vesuvius , Italy , as well as mozzarella , and the dough is made of wheat flour , natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer 's yeast , salt and water .
It 's baked in a stone oven with oak - wood fire , for a lighter , airier and crispier crust .
Una is a Neapolitan - style pizzeria from chef Anthony Mangieri that reopened on Manhattan 's Lower East Side in May 2018 , and it 's a top pick . "
Una originally started 25 years ago in the East Village , but Mangieri decided he was over the New York City life and moved himself ( and the restaurant ) to San Francisco , " says Coniglio . "
At the time , there were a lot of wood - burning ovens in N.Y.C. but not the legitimate Neapolitan style that we see more of today .
Who knew that a tattooed kid from Jersey would be the one to do it best ?
Mangieri is a pizza savant , and a true artist .
He just has a gift . "
The oven and space where Mangieri works is set up like an art gallery , encased in glass , and customers can come to the restaurant and watch him . "
It 's like watching a famous artist at work .
He only cooks a couple pizzas at a time , giving lots of care and attention to each pie .
His pizzas are n't flashy , he only has a few on the menu at a time , and each are $ 25 , " says Coniglio .
Diners can order non - pizza entrees , like a beef tenderloin crudo or marinated white asparagus with cured egg yolk and bottarga .
Reservations are recommended .
Whole pies , like Margharita with " pomodoro san Marzano , mozzarella di bufala and basilico , " are $ 25 .
Pizza Suprema Coniglio 's favorite New York slice is at Pizza Suprema . "
Pizza Suprema is consistent and very unassuming .
Italian - family - owned and operated , it 's been around for over 50 years and still has those old - school vibes with the orange trays and boxy booths .
It 's located across from Penn Station so it 's great for people traveling to and from Manhattan via train , and they are set up to do super high volume so they excel at feeding the masses at peak times , " says Coniglio . "
I think this is a spot for real New Yorkers , the staple slice . "
The Slice Harvester , a man who tried a slice of pizza at every pizzeria in N.Y.C ( 373 slices ) , has also said Pizza Suprema was his favorite slice .
The restaurant uses 100 percent " Grande " cheese , which is a high - end , authentic Italian cheese , and shreds real wheels of " Pecorino Romano " cheese in the back .
A slice of Round Cheese pizza , topped with the housemade tomato sauce and Grande Mozzarella and Romano cheeses , is $ 3.50 .
Los Angeles Steve Samson , owner of Sotto , has racked up many accolades for his pizza there .
Sampson has worked at Michelin - starred restaurants in Italy , like Quattro Passi in Sorrento and three - starred Dal Pescatore in Canneto sull'Oglio .
He 's opening another pizza spot , Superfine Pizza , later this month .
These are his favorite Los Angeles pizza spots .
DeSano Pizza Bakery When he 's not working on FOX 's " Hell 's Kitchen " with Gordon Ramsey , DeSano chef Marino Monferrato " is serious about making traditional Neapolitan pies , " says Samson .
DeSano in Los Angeles is Verace Pizzeria Napoletana certified ( VPN is the Neapolitan designation given to pizzerias that follow the strict use of ingredients and process for Neapolitan pies . )
DeSano is the citys best example of a simple Neapolitan pizza in an unfussy environment , says Samson . "
Across Italy , not just in Napoli , pizzerias are casual , uncomplicated spaces where friends can get together for an inexpensive bite and a glass of beer or wine .
DeSano is a large , wide open warehouse in a totally unexpected stretch west of Silver Lake .
You d never think to stop in if you did nt know where you were going . "
DeSano has one of the best crusts in town . "
They ve also got a great selection of wines , beer , cannoli and gelato .
Its communal tables and soccer on the TVs make it a great place for families and parties , " says Samson .
A whole , 11-inch pie starts at $ 10 .
The margherita pizza iwth San Marzano tomato , buffalo Mozzarella , basil and garlic is $ 12.75 .
Pizzana Opened April 2017 in Brentwood , Pizzana is owned by Sprinkles Cupcakes founder Candace Nelson and actor Chris O'Donnell . "
They make good neapolitan pizzas both with traditional and modern combinations , " says Samson . "
I always go for the traditional margherita and add anchovies wherever there is Neapolitan pizza , but they do n't have anchovies here so I opt for adding olives . "
Samson says Messicana , which has chorizo , jalapeno , ' queso fresco ' and a cilantro lime sauce , is also favorite .
Los Angeles Times food critic Jonathan Gold compared the pies to the best in the world . "
Does it resemble in some ways the modernized Margherita made famous by Franco Pepe , whose pizzeria in Caiazzo , north of Naples , is considered by some people ( including me ) to be the best in the world ?
It does , although Pepes pizza achieves its effect through stripes of concentrated sauces on a layer of cheese , and gives an impression of lushness rather than herbal intensity . "
Whole pies start at $ 18 .
The Messicana is $ 19 .
Prime " When you walk in , Prime feels like an old - school pizza joint you would find in New York , " says Samson . "
Although they focus on thin crust , New York - style pizzas , my favorite here is their Sicilian slice .
This comes from one of their square pies .
Its a great combination of fluffy focaccia - esque dough and crisped crust / edges , with tangy tomato sauce , garlic and mozzarella .
Prime has two locations : Fairfax Avenue and Little Tokyo . "
Both feel like hidden finds , " says Samson .

President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform at the Indiana Farm Bureau building on the Indiana State Fairgrounds September 27 , 2017 in Indianapolis , Indiana .

So do you have to worry about it or not ?
The good news is that if you were nt subject to the AMT before the reforms , you most certainly do nt have to worry about it now , unless you ve suddenly become much wealthier .
But tax advisors say that households who were at risk of having to pay this extra - high income tax in the past are still wise to see if it will apply to them today -- and to take evasive action if it might .
At risk are people with mid - six - figure incomes , lots of kids , itemized deductions and long - term capital gains , and holdings like incentive stock options and private - placement bonds , tax experts say .
In 2015 , the most recent year for which full - year data is available , 10.3 million individual taxpayers filed the AMT return , including more than 60 percent of households earning between $ 200,000 and $ 500,000 , according to The Tax Foundation .
That year , 4.9 percent of all taxpayers faced the AMT , paying a total of $ 33.2 billion , according to The Tax Policy Center . "
Which taxpayers are likely to be affected the most ?
Taxpayers with large families , employees who claimed a large amount of employee business expenses , very successful small business owners , " says Mark Steber , chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt , the tax - preparation firm , noting that far fewer taxpayers will face AMT now .
The first AMT was created in 1969 to make sure wealthier people could not use loopholes to escape income tax entirely , but it has been modified numerous times .
Under the AMT , people with higher incomes were not allowed to reduce taxable income with items like the personal exemption , deductions for state and local taxes and certain miscellaneous itemized deductions .
Even deductions for mortgage interest and medical expenses were lower than on the standard return , and the AMT was especially hard on successful small - business owners who took deductions , like accelerated depreciation on property and equipment .
James Boulette | Getty Images Taxpayers in potential AMT territory fill out an AMT return in addition to the ordinary return , then pay the larger of the two tax bills .
But the Bush tax cuts of 2001 had the perverse effect of making more taxpayers subject to AMT by reducing taxes on the regular return .
And the AMT was not indexed to inflation , so over time it applied to more and more taxpayers as incomes grew , dipping deep into the middle class that was not the original target .
Originally aimed at fewer than 200 high - income households , the AMT return was completed by more than 10 million households in 2015 , the latest year for which final figures are available , including nearly 60 percent of households earning between $ 200,000 and $ 500,000 , according to a Tax Foundation analysis of IRS data .
About 4.4 million households had to pay extra tax as a result .
Reducing a dreaded tax bite This has long been a contentious issue , and last year President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress changed the rules through passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to reduce the number of taxpayers affected and the cost they will bear .
The maximum AMT rate , for instance , dropped from 39.6 percent to 28 percent .
Among the numerous changes , the law increases the " exemption , " or income not subject to AMT , to $ 109,400 from $ 84,500 for married couples filing joint returns , and to $ 70,300 from $ 54,300 for single filers .
The second big change slows the pace of " phase - out , " which reduces the exemption as income gets larger .
For couples filing jointly , the exemption is cut by 25 percent of the income that exceeds $ 1 million , up from $ 160,900 in 2017 .
For other filers the phase - out threshold is now $ 500,000 , up from $ 120,700 for unmarried filers . "
The combination of these two changes makes it less likely for AMT to impact taxpayers , especially those at the lower income levels , " said Mike DAvolio , senior tax analyst at Intuit , the business and financial software company that produces the TurboTax tax software .
The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that about 600,000 taxpayers will pay AMT this year .
In addition , he said , the new tax law reduces some deductions on the regular return .
The personal exemption is eliminated , for example , and the deduction for state and local taxes is capped at $ 10,000 .
That means many taxpayers will not add those items back to income when they do their AMT return , further restricting the AMT income and reducing or eliminating AMT .
To reduce ones regular and AMT tax bill , folks can apply some general principles , such as deferring income by investing in a retirement plan and accelerating deductions by prepaying expenses .
Mike DAvolio senior tax analyst at Intuit He gives an example of a married couple with two children that files a joint return with $ 200,000 in income and deductions of $ 22,500 for state and local taxes , $ 17,000 in mortgage interest and $ 8,000 in itemized deductions .
In 2017 this household would have owed $ 1,494 in AMT on top of regular income tax , but they would have no AMT this year .
Who is still at risk
President Donald Trump 's pick for the Supreme Court is a big baseball fan -- and he racked up debts that went way beyond buying some peanuts and Cracker Jack at ballgames .
Brett Kavanaugh 's financial disclosure forms that are available for review show he reported up to $ 200,000 in debt he piled up on three credit cards -- Chase , Bank of America and USAA -- and a loan by the year 2016 .
The Washington Post quoted White House spokesman Raj Shah as saying that Kavanaugh built up the debt by buying Washington Nationals season tickets and also attending playoff games for himself and a " handful " of friends .
Shah said some of the debts were also for home improvements , the Post reported .
Kavanaugh 's financial disclosures show that he either paid off the debt or that the amount he owed fell below federal financial reporting guidelines .
Shah told the Postthat Kavanaughs friends reimbursed him for their share of the baseball tickets and that the judge has since stopped buying season tickets .
Kavanaugh 's love for baseball is well known .
His associates both in the legal sector and beyond describe him as a blue - collar , " Bud Light kind of guy " who enjoys the ballgames , and New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman was among the 150 high school classmates who signed a letter in support of him .
Cashman , Kavanaugh , Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch , and Arizona Cardinals team president Michael Bidwill all attended Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda , Maryland , together in the mid-1980s .
Kavanaugh , whose nomination by Trump has come under fire from the left , has n't commented publicly on the debts .
USA TODAY 's efforts to reach the White House on the matter were unsuccessful .
The financial disclosure forms for the years 2012 through 2017 also show relatively meager assets to go along with Kavanaugh 's debt load .
His most recent form shows less than $ 70,000 in assets .
The Postreported that previous Supreme Court justices have typically listed well over $ 1 million in assets .
The paper reported that Shah said in an interview that Kavanaugh has a government retirement account worth nearly half a million dollars that is not required to be disclosed on his financial forms .
The value of Kavanaugh 's residence is also not required to be disclosed .
Shah defended the nominee 's financial status , saying that he has not amassed wealth while working in the private legal sector . "
Judge Kavanaugh is a brilliant jurist who has dedicated his life to public service , " Shah told the Post .

While waiting , he has written some 300 opinions and sent 41 of his law clerks to similar posts at the high court -- far more than any of his competitors for the nomination . "
There is no one in America more qualified for this position , " Trump said in introducing Kavanaugh and his family to a packed East Room at the White House filled with Republican and conservative supporters .
Nearly everyone interviewed ahead of Kavanaugh 's nomination described him to USA TODAY as a sports junkie who lives and dies with the up - and - down Washington Nationals . "
He has been fortunate to have various experiences in his past like most of us regular mortals will never have , " said Howard Bashman , an appellate lawyer in Pennsylvania who clerked with Kavanaugh at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and attends Nats games with him . "
But he knows what it is to be a regular person . "
President Donald Trump 's son - in - law , Jared Kushner , a senior White House adviser , still lacks the highest security clearance , the Washington Post reported Thursday night , so he has been blocked from seeing parts of the President 's Daily Brief .
Experts told the Post that that could be severely hamper him from doing his job .
In May , Kushner finally received a permanent security clearance after more than a year in his White House position .
But the Post reported he only has " top secret " clearance , which prevents him from seeing the most classified materials .
The CIA appears to have not yet approved Kushner 's higher access , the Post said , though it was unclear exactly why .
Kushner has been interviewed twice by special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigators , and his name has come up on a number of occasions in the Russian meddling investigation .
President Trump will head to London on Friday , where he 's expected to face protests at every turn .
And with a giant " Trump Baby " balloon set to fly in the air over multiple demonstrations , U.S. officials urged Americans to " keep a low profile " in the English capital .
In an alert on Tuesday , the U.S. Embassy in London warned citizens about " numerous demonstrations " planned between Thursday and Sunday that could " attract large crowds " less than friendly to U.S. citizens . "
Exercise caution if unexpectedly in the vicinity of large gatherings that may become violent , " the embassy said in a list of advised actions , asking Americans to " keep a low profile " and " be aware of your surroundings . "
Talks with Prime Minister Theresa May , a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II and a trip to Scotland all made Trump 's schedule for his three - day U.K. visit beginning Friday .
Trump will travel by helicopter once there , making it unlikely he 'll see protests firsthand .
Already his visit has triggered the largest U.K. police mobilization since 2011 , the Guardian reported .
More than 50,000 signed up to protest on Friday alone , per Reuters .
One such protest will entail a 19-foot - high orange balloon shaped like Trump as a baby , which London Mayor Sadiq Khan -- who 's feuded with the president -- approved under " the right to peaceful protest . "
Most of the protests will take place that day in central London , the U.S. officials said , with some occurring the days before and after .
After the visit , Trump will decamp to Finland for a one - on - one with Russian President Vladimir Putin on July 16 .

Jobs in the U.S. grew by 177,000 in June , the report said , while economists polled by Thomson Reuters expected a gain of 190,000 .
June also marked the fourth straight month of jobs growth below 200,000 .
Jobs growth for the previous month , however , was revised up by 11,000 to 189,000 . "
Business number one problem is finding qualified workers , " Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moodys Analytics , said in a statement . "
At the current pace of job growth , if sustained , this problem is set to get much worse .
These labor shortages will only intensify across all industries and company sizes . "
Medium - size businesses , which employ 50 to 499 people , added 80,000 payrolls in June , while large businesses added 69,000 jobs .
Small businesses , which employ one to 49 people , saw payrolls increase by 29,000 .
Service providers added 148,000 payrolls , led by gains in education and health as well as leisure and hospitality .
Education and health services payrolls grew by 46,000 jobs last month while leisure and hospitality jobs grew by 33,000 .
Information technology , however , saw a contraction of 2,000 jobs in June .
The goods - producing sector , meanwhile , added 29,000 jobs , led by gains in construction and manufacturing of 13,000 and 12,000 , respectively .
The gains come amid concerns that a tight jobs market could put upward pressure on wages and generate an inflation spike that would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than the market anticipates .
The report from ADP and Moodys comes ahead of the U.S. governments monthly nonfarm payrolls report , which is scheduled for release Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET .
Correction : An earlier version misstated Friday 's release time for the nonfarm payrolls report .
It is 8:30 a.m. ET .

Public health officials in two states said Thursday they are investigating a link between an increase in a parasitic infection and consumption of McDonalds Corp. salads , and the fast - food chain said that it is stopping salad sales in thousands of its Midwest locations .
Iowa and Illinois public health departments posted notices Thursday afternoon that they were looking into cases of Cyclospora infections , which can cause diarrhea , fatigue and other symptoms .
Iowa official said they had found that 15 people in that state had contracted the infection after eating McDonalds MCD , -0.17 % salads , while the Illinois Department of Public Health said about a quarter of the cyclosporiasis 90 patients identified in that state also reported eating salads from the fast - food chain .
Quinoa , ambient lighting and Perrier .
They 're certainly not be synonymous with fast food giant McDonald 's , but if a new concept being tested out in Hong Kong proves successful , that could change .
A branch was renovated last year into what the company called , McDonald 's Next .
Here , a burger and fries are delivered to customer 's tables on a cutting board with real metal utensils -- not plastic .
McDonald 's did not respond to inquiries for its future plans for the concept .
But , here 's what CNBC observed during a recent visit : 1 .
The food is fancy While an old - fashioned Big Mac is certainly an option at McDonald 's Next , a fancier burger is probably a better option .
CNBC ordered a burger on a brioche bun , complete with caramelized onions , truffle - flavored sauce and grilled pineapple .
A burger , fries and salty - caramel latte cost $ 8.92 .

Your food comes to you In the evenings , customers have the option of getting their food delivered to their table .
At checkout , customers take a table card , find a seat , and an employee then brings the items to them .
3 .
Juice up with its wireless chargers Tables here have multiple wireless chargers -- wherein guests can place their phone on a charger for free , without the use of any cords .
The tables also have USB ports for charging , too .

Save some room for dessert At the McCafe counter , within McDonald 's , the dessert menu boasts items from cakes made onsite to sweet potato ice cream sundae served on a waffle .
There are also signs which show where its coffee beans originate from , which include : Guatemala , Sumatra , and Ethiopia .
McDonald 's also sells bags of its coffee beans so customers can brew at home .
5 .
Wash up , next to the counter Instead of hunting down a bathroom when you really just want to freshen up -- which at some locations could involve asking for a key , punching in a door code , or even paying ( even if you 're a paying customers ) -- McDonald 's Next offers a hand - washing station in the center of its restaurant .
The automated experience starts the moment you put your hands under the faucet .
First , soapy water is dispensed , followed by regular water to rinse and the it ends with a paper towel dispensing from the top of the station .
Whether you 're ready or not , the experience happens .

Rand Paul Whether or not to expand NATO is a question that deserves debate .
Would it help or hurt U.S. national security ?
Does adding countries such as Albania and Montenegro increase our security or ensnare us in possible regional disputes ?
Are we willing to risk war with Russia by including countries that already are mired in military conflict with Russia ?
To understand what NATO expansion does to our relations with Russia , one must at least be aware of Russias perspective .
Such awareness does not mean we agree with their point of view , but rather that we are aware our actions lead to reactions , and that NATO expansion does not occur in a vacuum .
We once had robust and thoughtful debate in our country over diplomacy and our desire to avoid war .
Both parties now tend to shake their fists and declare to our adversaries : " Take this sanction . " "
Take this expansion of NATO . " "
Take this travel restriction " -- under the misguided notion our unilateral actions will lead to capitulation .
Instead , we ve often seen rising tensions , increased nationalism and a ratcheting up of a Cold War - like fever .
There was a time when many cautioned against reckless expansion .
OUR VIEW : Donald Trump 's tirades weaken NATO and please Vladimir Putin Perhaps the most famous diplomat of the last century , George Kennan , wrote that NATO expansion would be a " fateful error " that would " inflame the nationalistic , anti - Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion " and " restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East - West relations . "
Similarly , Daniel L. Davis , retired lieutenant colonel with Defense Priorities , said , " Extending NATO membership to Georgia -- or Ukraine , as others advocate -- in no way strengthens U.S. security , but rather unequivocally increases Americas strategic risk . "
I prefer we think of our interests first , and that the U.S. Senate return to being a deliberative body on foreign policy , where ideas are considered , and dissent is heard and debated .
Sen. Rand Paul , R - Ky . ,
serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
He was one of two senators who opposed Tuesdays nonbinding motion to support and expand NATO .

Raymond James analysts downgraded AT&T Inc. 's rating on Friday to market perform from outperform , saying the Department of Justice appeal of the acquisition of Time Warner , now WarnerMedia is a " negative catalyst " for the stock .
On Thursday , the Department of Justice announced it would be appealing the June 12th court ruling approving AT&T 's T purchase of Time Warner .
In his opinion at the time , U.S. District Judge Richard Leon rejected the Justice Department 's original argument that the deal would suppress competition in the pay - TV industry .
Although Raymond James says it is confident the merger will be unaffected , " investors will likely be unenthusiastic in holding the shares during the process , as they did during the last trial . "
AT&T is still " attractively valued , " analysts wrote , but " an appeal de - railing the positive benefits of the merger gives us pause . "
AT&T shares have dropped 17 % so far this year , while the S&P 500 spx has risen 4.7 % .
Recently one of us was talking to a financial adviser from a medium - sized town in the South .
A fried chicken restaurant in the town , a favorite among locals , had just announced plans to expand regionally with the ultimate goal of becoming the next Shake Shack or Chipotle .
The advisers phone was ringing off the hook with requests from his clients to invest in the venture .
When he attempted to explain to them the complexity of the restaurant industry and the incredible risk associated with such an investment , he was met with a common refrain : " How can this go wrong ?
The chicken is so crispy and delicious . "
His clients enthusiasm makes a certain intuitive sense .
One of the most common pieces of financial advice we hear is to " invest in what you know . "
The advice is rooted in the philosophy of famed investors like Berkshire Hathaways BRK.B , -0.61 % Warren Buffett , who has attributed his success to staying within his " circle of competence . "
As the chicken example suggests , lay investors often misinterpret and misapply the philosophy , confusing a vague feeling of understanding with the fundamental research that Buffett and others are advocating .
Peter Lynch , another investor closely associated with the philosophy , recently lamented , " I ve never said , if you go to a mall , see a Starbucks SBUX , -0.89 % and say its good coffee , you should call Fidelity brokerage and buy the stock . ...
People buy a stock and they know nothing about it . "
Conflating issues New research of ours , forthcoming in the Journal of Marketing Research , sheds light on why people are so apt to misunderstand the " invest in what you know " philosophy : People tend to conflate their sense of understanding of what a company does with the risk of investing in the company .
When we think we understand what a company does , like making great chicken , we judge it to be a safer investment .
Unfortunately , peoples sense of understanding of what a company does is completely worthless as a guide to actual risk , meaning that relying on it is an unwise investment strategy .
In a first series of studies , participants read company descriptions of all companies in the S&P 500 Index SPX , -1.18 % .
These descriptions include information about what the companies do , what its major lines of business are , where it is headquartered , who the CEO is and so on .
We asked people to rate how well they understood what the company does and also asked them to rate how risky it would be to invest .
Companies rated as easier to understand were rated as substantially safer .
But when we collected data on the actual risk of the companies such as measures of volatility and rate of return , the easier - to - understand companies were no safer .
We also measured peoples risk perceptions in a more precise way , by asking them to make numerous guesses about how the stock would perform over the next year .
People predicted that easier - to - understand companies would perform better and their guesses also fell within a narrower range , suggesting they thought performance was more predictable .
Again , neither of those beliefs was borne out when we looked at the actual risk data .
In another study , we manipulated company descriptions to make them easier or harder to understand by changing the order in which information was presented .
Despite judging the exact same companies , our participants thought they were riskier to invest in when the descriptions were harder to understand .
In a final study , we asked people to play the role of financial adviser and pick a portfolio of stocks for two clients .
One of the clients was young and aggressive with a large appetite for risk .
The other was older , close to retirement and risk averse .
The participants were able to pick from a group of stocks , some that were rated as easier to understand and some that were rated as hard to understand .
We also gave them additional information such as analyst ratings and charts of past performance .
Regardless of the true riskiness of the stocks , our participants allocated more of the portfolio to easy - to - understand companies for the risk - averse client , and more to the hard - to - understand companies for the risk - seeking client .
Experts fall for it too What was particularly interesting about this study is that , in addition to testing investing novices , we also tested experienced investors in an online investing community where people discuss strategies , share stock picks and analyze portfolio results together .
These people actively trade at least weekly and hold over $ 100,000 in assets in their portfolios , with some managing millions in assets .
Those experts showed the same effect , allocating more to easy - to - understand companies for the risk - averse investor .
The only difference from the novices is that they allocated a lot more to the easy - to - understand companies overall .
This probably reflects how ingrained the " invest in what you know " philosophy has become among expert investors .
Ironically , even the experts misinterpret the advice .
Why do people do this ?
We believe it comes from our natural tendency to use understanding as a guide to risk in other domains of life .
If I do not understand something , say , a wild animal or a new contraption , it makes sense to be wary .
The problem is that we often think we understand things when we do not ; for instance , when we focus on a restaurants delicious chicken but neglect the complexities of the business .
That error will cause us to take on more risk than we intend and can lead to major trouble .
So what should you do with this knowledge ?
We believe the key is being realistic .
As lay investors , the radius of our circle of competence is essentially zero .
Most of us do not have the expertise and resources to do real research .
Put your money in highly diversified assets that provide a desired return over time .
The challenge is sticking to this strategy .
The sense of understanding is alluring and it is easy to be drawn into the trap of thinking we understand things better than we do .
Now that you know about this trap , you know how to avoid it .
This article is based on " Circle of Incompetence : Sense of Understanding as an Improper Guide to Investment Risk , " forthcoming at Journal of Marketing Research , written by Andrew Long ( University of Colorado - Boulder ) , Philip Fernbach ( University of Colorado - Boulder ) and Bart De Langhe ( ESADE -- Ramon Llull University ) .

Here at Reviewed , we ve cooked with fancy induction ranges , magical Instant Pots , and beautiful Dutch ovens , but we enjoy cooking in unconventional ways , too .
After making dinner in a dishwasher , we were looking for new cooking challenges .
And in a recent heat wave , it was just way too hot to cook .
Since everyone here loves pizza , we thought we d try another experiment -- baking a pie on the dashboard of a car .
The preparation Credit : Mike Roorda / Reviewed We wanted to keep it as simple as possible , so our shopping list was short . *
Since we knew the car temperature ( which was about 104 degrees at the time of cooking ) would never be able to bake dough , we purchased a pre - made pizza crust . *
Along with that , we got a can of tomato sauce and some fresh - sliced mozzarella .
That , plus some oregano from our office , was it . *
We put our pizza on a baking sheet and it was ready to go .
To prep the car , we simply pulled it into a spot in our parking lot where it was facing the sun , and laid a trash bag over the dashboard to prevent any leakage .
ADVERTISEMENT After setting up a GoPro camera to monitor it ( we could also look directly down at it through our office window ) , we slid the pizza into the " oven " and left it to bake in the sun .
Credit : Connor Whooley / Reviewed The process When we put the pizza in , our plan was to let it cook for an hour and come back to it .
With the ability to look out our office window , we could peer down and see exactly what was happening .
Credit : Connor Whooley / Reviewed * The cheese was noticeably melting right away , while the sauce got a little runny and seeped into one side of the crust ( more on that later ) . *
After half an hour , it was clear that the pizza was " cooking , " but we also could tell it would need more time , so we decided to tack on another 30 minutes . *
Finally , after an hour and a half , we pulled the pizza out of the car .
The baking sheet was very hot to the touch and the pizza looked ( somewhat ) like what a cooked margarita should look like .
At last , it was time to dig in .
The results BEFORE Credit : Mike Roorda / Reviewed AFTER Credit : Mike Roorda / Reviewed Using a premade crust in low heat led us to believe there would be no crispy crust on our pizza , but interestingly enough , we were wrong . *
The crust on one side of the pizza had browned a tiny bit , and while they were nt like brick oven slices , there was a noticeable crispness to them .
ADVERTISEMENT * The problem was on the other side .
Since the dashboard was slightly tilted , the sauce had run onto the crust , leaving it soggy .
We could ve baked the crust beforehand for a better crisp , but in the spirit of the test , that just did nt seem right . *
The sauce was fine for a canned tomato sauce and some dried oregano , while the cheese was slightly melted .
Next time , we think we would try shredded mozzarella instead .
Our conclusion Overall , after testing it with coworkers , we all agreed that it was nt the worst pizza we d ever had .
Heck , it was even better than some of the frozen pizzas we had tried in our massive taste test .
ADVERTISEMENT And there was one final discovery as well .
While it may not be the most optimal place to actually cook your pizza , it could be a pretty solid way to heat up a cold slice .
So , whether you re at the beach , out for a drive , or just parked in your driveway , its another method to think about .

Remember earlier this year when we told you about a bronze bust of Conor McGregor that some artist had made and was putting up for sale ?
Remember how the joke there was that it would only cost you $ 4,600 to have the former UFC champs head sitting on your mantel , like the classy fight fan you are ?
Yeah , well , get ready , because the stakes just got raised .
According to the BBC , Lithuanian sculptor Edgar Askelovic - better known as the artist Aspencrow - just spent five months creating a more than 200-pound sculpture of McGregor that he calls " Atlas " ( via Instagram ) .
Though Aspencrow , who is known for his " hyper - realistic " depictions of celebrities , said he has never met McGregor , he did claim to have communicated with the fighter through McGregors " friends . " "
That s how I got the information that he knows about the sculpture , and that he accepts it , " Aspencrow told the BBC .
The sculpture is set to be unveiled at the JD Malat Gallery in London on July 14 , which , of course , is McGregors 30th birthday .
Aspencrow is reportedly also planning two more versions , with at least one going up for sale .
As for what he s trying to communicate by depicting McGregor lounging all shirtless and smoldering in a solid wall of rock , that s where it gets interesting . "
Its up to you what you see in it , " Aspencrow said . "
You can see him as a prisoner , or a god , or just as a person . "
OK , well , it did not occur to me to see him as a god until you said that , but fine , I guess that s not too weird . "
I like Conor McGregor .
He s a great guy , " Aspencrow continued . "
I feel he s my soulmate .
Some of the decisions he makes might not be correct , but none of us are ideal . "
And now its officially weird .
Cool .
Thanks for that .

Rescued schoolboys are moved from a Royal Thai Police helicopter to an awaiting ambulance at a military airport in Chiang Rai , Thailand , July 8 , 2018 .
Athit Perawongmetha | Reuters Rescue workers in Thailand brought out four people on Monday from a flooded cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach were trapped for more than two weeks , apparently taking the total number rescued to eight .
A Reuters witness near the Tham Luang cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai saw medical personnel carrying four people out of the cave to waiting ambulances over the course of the day .
The rescue operation was launched on Sunday and four boys were brought out that day .
They were in good condition in hospital , officials said .
A fifth boy was brought out earlier on Monday , a navy official said , and three more were seen being brought out over subsequent hours .
Reuters could not confirm the identity of the three people brought out in the evening and the chief of the rescue mission , Narongsak Osottanakorn , declined to comment , saying a news conference would be held later on Monday .
The " Wild Boars " soccer team and their coach got trapped on June 23 when they set out to explore the vast cave complex after soccer practice , when a rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels .
British divers found the 13 , huddled on a muddy bank in a partly flooded chamber several kilometres inside the complex , on Monday last week .
The dangerous bid to rescue the boys - aged between 11 and 16 - got going again hours earlier on Monday after a break to replenish oxygen supplies and make other preparations deep inside the cave complex .
Authorities have said the mission could take three or four days to complete .
It is a race against the clock with heavy rain expected in coming days , which would again dangerously flood the tunnels with fast flowing , and rising , water .
The rescue team went into the cave to resume the operation at 11 a.m. ( 0400 GMT ) , Narongsak told a news conference earlier , adding he expected good news .
Thirteen foreign divers and five members of Thailand 's elite navy SEAL unit make up the main team guiding the boys to safety through narrow , submerged passageways that claimed the life of a former Thai navy diver on Friday .
Narongsak said that the " same multinational team " that went into the cave on Sunday to retrieve the first four boys was deployed on Monday .
He did not say how many boys the team hoped to bring out on Monday .
On Sunday , divers held the first four boys close to bring them out , and each had to wear an oxygen mask to enable normal breathing , authorities said .
Narongsak said rescuers had to tighten a guide rope as part of their preparations for the second phase of the rescue on Monday .
Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda told reporters the four boys rescued on Sunday were in good health in hospital but did not give details .
There was no word on the condition of any of the people brought out on Monday .
Infection fears Authorities have not confirmed the identity of the first four boys rescued .
Some of the boys ' parents told Reuters they had not been told who had been rescued and that they were not allowed to visit the hospital .
Narongsak said the first four rescued boys had not been identified out of respect for the families whose sons were still trapped , adding that the boys were being kept away from their parents due to fear of infection . "
The four children are well at Chiang Rai Prachanukroh hospital .
But they still need to be kept away from their parents and others due to fear about infection , " he said .
Medical teams previously said concerns included hypothermia and an airborne lung infection known as " cave disease " , which is caused by bat and bird droppings .
Somboon Sompiangjai , 38 , the father of one of the trapped boys , said parents were told by rescuers ahead of Sunday 's operation the " strongest children " would be brought out first . "
We have not been told which child has been brought out ... We ca n't visit our boys in hospital because they need to be monitored for 48 hours , " Somboon told Reuters . "
I 'm hoping for good news , " he said .

Researchers claim they have created a gene editing technique capable of reprogramming immune cells , potentially paving the way for breakthrough treatments for cancer and other conditions .
Scientists at the University of California San Francisco developed a method where they use a " cut and paste " system to rewrite sequences in immune cells , or T cells .
They also use a process involving electrical fields on cells to make them more permeable for a brief time . "
This is a rapid , flexible method that can be used to alter , enhance , and reprogram T cells so we can give them the specificity we want to destroy cancer , recognize infections , or tamp down the excessive immune response seen in autoimmune disease , " said Alex Marson , an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at UCSF , and senior author of the study , in a statement .
Researchers used CRISPR , a tool used to edit genes .
In one set of experiments , scientists native receptors in immune cells with receptors created to seek out melanoma cells .
When they were transferred in mice implanted with human melanoma tumors , the special cells moved directly to the tumor .
In a separate experiment , researchers used the method to repair cells from three human siblings with a rare autoimmune disease .
Their findings were published in the journal Nature .

Restructuring fads come and go .
However , a recent practice that has caught my eye is asking employees to " reapply " for their jobs .
The practice -- which makes workers particularly uncomfortable -- is rooted at least in part in the world of " post - merger integration , " often a euphemism for lots of people running around trying to root out cost and justify the transaction that just took place .
The idea is that as a new entity takes form , it makes sense that prospective employees of that new entity -- even if they came from one of its forbears -- should apply afresh for their role .
Though it may put us on edge , there is a kernel of value in the practice : it reminds us that we , just like our organizations , are nt guaranteed a future .
Based in part on my research , heres what professionals need to do in an era of exponential change .
Embrace impermanence by bringing a beginners mind .
Until recently , it was perfectly reasonable to expect some degree of permanence for successful , established organizations .
But in the past three years , we have seen mounting evidence that every company faces an existential threat to some extent -- and with that threat comes vulnerability to employees .
As individuals , its difficult to overcome the inherent belief that established companies will last forever , and the idea that our jobs in those companies will exist as long as we keep on following the playbooks .
And its almost impossible to imagine that the somewhat linear " career path " we might have planned out is essentially defunct , along with the series of positions that we imagined along the way .
Companies that identify and challenge the orthodoxy and conventional wisdom that feed into their playbooks -- including static organizational charts and career paths -- will be much better at counteracting the threat of disruption .
In blowing up the playbooks , they will force themselves to continuously consider first principles for what they do and how they do it .
Why you do n't need to worry about robots stealing your future job This means any worker expecting to make it over the long haul needs to shift from a mindset of permanence ( job security , linear career paths , predictable outcomes ) to one of impermanence .
Rather than focusing inwardly on how we get to the next level on the org chart , we need to be looking outwardly to understand the nature of change around us .
What s changing in our profession ?
What s changing in our industry ?
Are we honing the right skills and leveraging the best tools to keep pace or get ahead ?
Collectively we need to nurture a culture of impermanence by recognizing we ca nt possibly be experts based on past experience when we face an unpredictable and unknowable future .
Instead , we need to be willing to look at business choices and strategic moves as if we are newcomers to the industry .
Ironically , the one thing that best led to job security in the past -- following the playbooks carefully -- may now be an accelerant to obsolescence .
Take re - application as a valuable career nudge .
Its easy to feel as though a request to reapply for a position sits somewhere between annoying and insulting .
Most of us who have performed well within a company naturally expect that performance is noticed , appreciated , and rewarded -- at least in part by continued employment .
But what if that performance is being measured against criteria reflecting capabilities which may no longer be relevant ?
Once upon a time in my consulting career I earned kudos for being able to design information - packed transparencies for use with overhead projectors .
I m pretty sure that does nt matter so much anymore .
Though it may sound a bit starry - eyed , the idea of reapplying for a job that otherwise feels secure could be a good thing : it forces us to pick up our heads and consider our relevance in a rapidly changing business world .
It helps us find our blind spots and pinpoints skills that we need to build to stay competitive .
It reminds us that instead of complaining about so - and - sos hiring or promotion , we should be investing in ourselves to stay competitive .
Use your resume as a catalyst for introspection .
Whether we call it a curriculum vitae , a resume , or a personal synopsis -- and whether its a single piece of paper in black - and - white , a lively video , a fancy creative portfolio , or a standard template filled out online -- just about everyone in business has a pithy celebration of who they are and what they have accomplished .
Pulling together our first resume tends to be an exercise in stretching the profound importance of an early babysitting job , debating the inclusion of the grade - point average or wondering whether walking the family dog counts as community service .
As time goes on and we gain more experience , the challenge shifts to becoming more concise while attempting to match personal adjectives to desired candidate traits .
No matter where you are in your career , this exercise requires self - reflection .
But its almost always retrospective and happens all too infrequently .
Admittedly , I once went 12 years without dusting off my resume .
Learn to code , it might save your job However , as change accelerates , so too does the half - life of relevance of any persons qualifications .
Instead of occasionally keeping a journal of your past achievements when you are ready for a change , think of your resume as a living document that must evolve with the changing world around you .
Revisiting your CV a few times a year will help you recognize when you re settling back into autopilot and possibly give you some inspiration to make some changes .
As you get started , consider some predictable ponderings like : How do I compare to others for this job ?
What skills have I built and which ones do I need to shore up ?
How has what s valued in the business world evolved since I last had to apply for a job ?
How can I best position myself for success in my next role ?
What do I really value in my work life ?
And , what do I want to spend my precious time doing ?
Our personal development contributes to our organizations competitive differentiation .
By clinging to rigid organizational structures and roles , we make ourselves and our companies resistant to change and susceptible to disruption .
By constantly evolving , we stand a much better chance of creating a future within an organization that is more adaptive to change .
To get there , we just need our individual egos to get out of our way .

Rhonda Abrams Special for USA TODAY For more than a decade , I ran my small business from my home .
I loved it .
I d boast about my " one room commute " to friends when they d complain about being stuck in commuter traffic .
My business eventually outgrew my home office , but I still work from home regularly .
So over the years , I discovered a number of secrets of success in running a small business from home .
These seven tips will help you succeed , too : 1 .
Find a good space to work .
If you have a separate room or garage you can turn into an office , that s ideal , but its not always possible .
What s important is to carve out a space you can use regularly , and almost exclusively , as your office .
It should be in a place where other family members are nt coming and going during your work hours .
My first home " office " was a corner of my dining area where I put a desk , a filing cabinet and my computer .
Even if you have to use one end of your dining room table , try to have a space without too many distractions .
2 .
Establish work hours .
One of the most difficult tasks for people who run a small business from home is establishing a clear distinction between work life and home life .
It really helps if you establish a work routine that makes you , your family and others conscious of when you re working and when you re available .
That does nt mean you have to work from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ; just establish real working hours .
And yes , as part of your regular hours , you can carve time out of your day to pick up kids or go to the gym - just let everyone know that s part of the plan .
3 .
Find places to meet with customers or just for escape .
Today , the work - at - home entrepreneur has a whole bunch of options if they need to meet customers in person to get work done without the distractions of home life or just to be around other people .
Bring your laptop to a local cafe -- remember , though , be respectful of the owners and other patrons .
Or you can find work spaces , meeting places and conference rooms to rent by the hour , day or week through many co - working spaces such as WeWork , Liquidspace or ShareDesk .
4 .
Make child care arrangements .
I love kids , but lets be real .
Kids are noisy and demanding .
Its not realistic to expect to get work done with kids coming in and out , wanting to be driven places , needing a snack , wanting attention .
Consider making child care arrangements depending on your childrens ages and the nature of your work .
Whatever your arrangement , develop a structured routine for your kids that keeps them busy ( and out of your hair ) for a set period of time each week so you can get work done .
5 .
Deal with pets .
A dog or cat makes working at home less lonely .
But just as you ca nt have a screaming child in the background when you re on a call , you ca nt have a barking dog - at least not often .
If your dog barks a lot and you have to make calls , put it in another room while you work .
If your cat is really noisy , get a different cat .
6 .
Be clear with guests about your spare time .
Having out - of - town guests visit can be delightful , but its also likely to be a strain on your work - at - home routine .
Guests think since you re home , you re available .
Let them know in advance how much time you ll be able to spend with them .
Put this in the most positive light : " I m delighted I ve been able to cancel my meetings for Thursday afternoon to spend with you .
Until then , I m sure you ll enjoy exploring the city on your own . "
If you need to , make up a list of sights or keep brochures on hand so visitors can find ways to entertain themselves .
7 .
Use apps to stay productive .
Its easy to get distracted when you work at home and start spending too much time on social media or solitaire .
Instead , use apps to keep you focused and block out distracting sites and games , such as Freedom www.freedom.to or Cold Turkey www.getcoldturkey.com or SelfControl www.selfcontrolapp Rhonda Abrams is the author of Six - Week Start Up , just released in its fourth edition .

RIDGELAND -- Zy McDonald felt nervous .
He was sitting in a directors chair inside WAPTs studio last week for an on - camera interview .
Ridgeland head coach Ryan Earnest sat to his right .
McDonald , Earnests sophomore quarterback , had never been interviewed before , much less on camera .
Growing up he and his cousin and his brother interviewed each other after backyard football games , but that was imaginary .
A quiet and reserved person who does nt seek the spotlight -- coaches strain to hear him say " hello " in the school hallways -- McDonald called his uncle , Deuce McAllister , for advice the day before .
McAllister , who played at Ole Miss before an eight - year NFL career with the Saints , told his nephew to speak up , make eye contact with the interviewer , look at the camera and answer questions about himself by discussing his teammates .
McDonald looked uncomfortable but he answered all the questions directed at him .
And should McDonald meet the goals he has for himself -- a state championship , a label as the best player in Mississippi , a Hall of Fame NFL career -- the interview will be the first of many . "
Its just going to be a matter of time before he takes off , " Earnest said . "
He s got a shot , " McAllister said .
This summer , McDonald has added about 10 pounds and attended a camp at Ole Miss. McAllister also sent him to Mobile , Alabama , to work with former Ole Miss quarterback David Morris at QB Country .
This time last year McDonald spent his days practicing with the freshman team as he prepared for his first high school season .
At about 5-foot-9 and 155 pounds , McDonald had no expectations of playing on the varsity team .
But Dillon Mitchell , Ridgelands projected starter , strained the UCL in his right elbow four weeks before the first game .
Earnest told McDonald to come to varsity workouts and gave him a folder filled with exercise instructions . "
As fall camp starts to play out its clear to everybody he s by far the best guy , " Earnest said . "
Even with that , I was hesitant .
You do nt want to ruin his confidence .
Playing 5A football for a ninth grader can be quite intimidating . "
On the field before an early August exhibition against Warren Central , Earnest and offensive coordinator Josh Crowder needed to decide if McDonald or senior Zion Smith would start at quarterback .
They flipped a coin .
McDonald won the toss .
In one quarter , McDonald led the Titans to two touchdowns . "
At that point , we decided lets go with him , " Earnest said . "
We have nt looked back . "

Risk of a recession in 2019 has significantly increased , analyst says Beat Wittmann , partner at Porta Advisors , discusses how macroeconomic indicators are heightening the prospect of a global recession .
Robert Powell Special to USA TODAY Outstanding student loan debt totaled $ 1.4 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2018 , according to a recent report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks Center for Microeconomic Data .
And that debt -- which ranges from $ 6,744 to $ 28,116 for the middle 50 % -- is creating a financial burden that could potentially hamper retirement saving by young adults , according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College .
While student debt itself does not significantly affect 401(k ) participation rates for young workers who attended college -- both those who graduated and those who did not -- it does seem to shape how much college graduates save , the report says . "
Those with debt have only about half as much in assets by age 30 as those without debt , " wrote the authors of the report , " Do Young Adults with Student Debt Save Less for Retirement ? "
For example , 30-year - old college graduates with no student loan debt have $ 18,200 saved for retirement on average while 30-year - old college graduates with student loan debt have saved on average between $ 9,000 to $ 9,300 . "
Young graduates consider the simple existence of a student loan --rather than its size -- to be a constraint on their 401(k ) saving , " the authors of the report wrote .
The authors noted that the drawback to such behavior is that some people save less for retirement than they could afford to early in their career .
A related concern is that some participants also may not contribute enough to receive the full employer match , leaving money on the table .
So , what might young workers with student debt do ?
Put things in perspective Instead of saving for retirement , young workers tend to place a greater emphasis on short - term goals like saving for homes , families , cash reserves and , of course , paying down student debt , according to Douglas Boneparth , president of Bone Fide Wealth . "
As long as you have identified , qualified and prioritized your goals , along with mastering your cash flow , do nt feel bad , " he says . "
There s a lot of guilt being thrown at millennials for their inability to save . "
In reality , he says , their financial circumstances are very different from the generations before them . "
They have student loan debt , low wage growth and more necessary expenses such as data plans , " he says .
Focus on your priorities Kristi Sullivan , a certified financial planner with Sullivan Financial Planning , also recommends focusing on priorities . "
First , build an emergency fund in your savings account of at least three months ' living expenses , " she says .
And then , once your emergency fund is established , she and other advisers recommend contributing enough to an employer - sponsored retirement plan to get the full match , rather than paying more than the minimum amount due on your student loans .
About 40 percent of companies contribute 50 cents for every dollar employees contribute up to 6 percent of their pay .
Pay off debt first As with most things having to do with money , there are differences of opinion . "
To meet the objective of household wealth maximization , it is often best for individuals to focus solely on paying off student loans before they begin to save for retirement , " says David Nanigian , the director of the personal financial planning program at the Mihaylo College of Business and Economics at California State University .
But do nt follow that rule of thumb in the absence of some old - fashioned number crunching .
Indeed , Nanigian recommends evaluating three scenarios to determine which might result in the greatest level of wealth depending on ones target retirement date : 1 .
Pay off student loans as quickly as possible , and then save as much as possible for retirement .
2 .
Pay off student loans as quickly as possible , but also contribute enough to ones employers retirement plan to receive the full employer match -- beginning ASAP .
3 .
Save as much as possible for retirement .
A question of math Mark Edwards , a lecturer for California Lutheran Universitys MBA in Financial Planning program , also recommends putting finger to calculator .
Whether you pay down your student debt loan as fast as possible , or save as much as possible for retirement or some combination of those tactics depends , Edwards says , on a number of issues .
They could include : compensation versus the amount needed to fund ones standard of living ; expected returns versus loan interest rates ; the tax deductibility of loans ; the ability to consolidate loans ; the need for an emergency fund ; and future expected income .
Others agree . "
We encourage clients to consider the long - term effects of where their extra dollars go , " says Autumn Campbell , a certified financial planner with The Planning Center . "
If it is higher interest rate debt , we encourage clients to pay down the debt quicker so they are not incurring high interest rate charges , " she says .
If , however , the debt has modest interest rate charges , and especially if it is a fixed rate , Campbell says the opportunity to invest extra dollars instead of paying down debt becomes more appealing .
Align your money with your values Many young workers prioritize paying down debt over saving for retirement due to the emotional weight and cash - flow strain the debt causes on their lives , says Campbell . "
When talking about where to put discretionary dollars with clients , we focus on their long - term vision and the values they hold , " she says . "
Some of our clients take great pride in being or becoming debt - free , while others want to optimize their situation in the long term , even if that means elongating their debt - payoff strategy . "
What if you do nt have a 401(k ) plan ?
If your employer does nt offer a plan or does nt offer a match , consider learning about the time value of money and how to calculate trade - offs . "
Its all about opportunity costs , " says Edwards . "
Contributing to an IRA with a low expected return versus applying those funds to paying down higher cost debt tips the balance towards debt reduction . "
Check your bottom line It really does boil down to the young workers particular job circumstances and comfort level with debt , says Edwards .
Others agree . "
If you are looking for an answer on whether to save for retirement or pay off debt , the answer is ' it depends , " says Campbell . "
Both are important , and at the end of the day as long as the extra dollars are going toward one or the other , it 's bounds ahead of having otherwise spent the money . "

Rod Mcguirk Associated Press CANBERRA , Australia - An Australian state police chief on Thursday made an historic apology to indigenous people who are overrepresented in prisons and vowed to improve race relations .
Western Australia Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said police were key participants in past wrongs against indigenous people in the state over decades , including enforcing government policies of removing mixed - race children from Aboriginal families until the 1970s .
The children are known as the Stolen Generations .
Many were institutionalized , abused and neglected . "
Some of the comments Ill be making shortly are confronting and may make some people feel uncomfortable , but I understand that truth - telling is an important part of enabling and facilitating change , " Dawson said in a speech at police headquarters in Perth . "
And so today , on behalf of the Western Australian Police Force , I would like to say ' sorry to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for our participation in past wrongful actions that have caused immeasurable pain and suffering , " he added .
The apology surprised some indigenous leaders but was widely welcomed .
Western Australia has the second - highest proportion of indigenous Australians after the Northern Territory .
Indigenous Australians make up only 3 percent of the national population , but 25 percent of Australias prison population .
Dawson said the history of conflict between the indigenous population and police included removing children from communities , tribes from their land , violence , racism and incarceration . "
I accept that previous laws , practices and policies deeply affected the lives of Aboriginal people and that police involvement in historical events has led to mistrust in law enforcement and the damaging of our relationship , " Dawson said . "
From this day forward and in my time as police commissioner , I will take steps to heal historical wounds between police and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people , " he added .
Dawson said race relations were improving .
Since police introduced an Aboriginal cadet program in 2016 , five cadets had become sworn police officers .
The state now had an indigenous - run police station in the Outback Aboriginal community of Warakuma , where the crime rate was falling , he said .

Roxanna Scott USA TODAY Sports Olympic gold medalist Kikkan Randall said on social media Wednesday she s recently been diagnosed with breast cancer .
Randall , along with U.S. teammate Jessie Diggins , made history in Pyeongchang by becoming the first American female cross country skiers to win an Olympic medal -- and it was gold .
The five - time Olympian wrote on Twitter that the prognosis is good after the cancer was detected early . "
My life will change quite a bit in the coming months , " she tweeted .
She is receiving treatment at a hospital in Anchorage , Alaska , and began her first round of chemotherapy Monday . "
It 's a scary thing to learn you have cancer and I have wondered every day since how this could have possibly happened to me , " Randall wrote in an Instagram post . "
But I have promised myself that I will remain positive and active and determined throughout my treatment . "
I am going to bring as much tenacity , strength , and energy toward this challenge as I have throughout my entire career . "
A trailblazer in womens cross country skiing , Randall , 35 , came back from maternity leave to make her fifth U.S. Olympic team .
She took off the 2015 - 16 season and gave birth to son Breck in April 2016 .
Until this years Pyeongchang Olympics , Bill Koch was the only American to reach the Olympic podium in the sport of cross country skiing , winning a silver medal in the 30-kilometer event at the 1976 Innsbruck Games .
After finishing the World Cup season in Sweden , Randall retired from competition .
She finished her career wtih three world championship medals , including gold in the team sprint in 2013 . "
Its been a really amazing journey for me through five Olympics , but it really got fun about six years ago when this womens team formed and the level has been rising and rising and rising , " Randall said after winning gold in South Korea . "
We talked about , if we won a medal at the Olympics it was truly going to be a team medal whether you were on the snow that day or not .
Its been in the works for a long time and its amazing to finally make it happen . "

SAINT PETERSBURG , Russia - Getting to a World Cup final is supposed to be hard .
For France , not so much .
A 1 - 0 victory over Belgium in Tuesdays semifinal here clinched Les Bleus a spot in Sundays championship showdown and , in truth , it has all looked pretty easy .
At no point in the tournament has the team looked in genuine danger , and never really moved into top gear , either .
Tense stalemate against your local rival ?
No problem .
The only goal saw Samuel Umtiti send an impressive header past goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the 51st minute , giving France an advantage that it would never relinquish .
Stuck in the stacked side of the draw ?
No worries there either , with Uruguay easily discarded in the quarterfinal and before that , a 4 - 3 win over Argentina that sounds far more difficult than it truly was .
Belgium did its part , seeing off Brazil in the quarterfinals .
Frances recipe has been rooted in consistency .
Not consistently outstanding , just consistently consistent .
Consistently better , just a little bit better , than all of its rivals , game after game .
That was the case here , blunting enough of Belgiums typically rampant attack to survive and advance with the minimum of fuss .
Maybe it has gotten lucky that all of its opponents have had off days when they have met .
Maybe when such a thing happens so often , it has nothing to do with chance .
For all of the destructive attacking forces in its arsenal , it is the backline that has held things together .
Hugo Lloris comfortably blocked a fierce second half drive from Axel Witsel , but was otherwise largely undisturbed .
Belgiums Romelu Lukaku could nt get anything going up front , Kevin De Bruyne had a rare off day , bringing the teams enjoyable and entertaining run to an unsatisfying close .
It was outplayed , by a bit .
Outcoached , by a bit .
Outworked , by the same margin .
That is what France does , and that s how it does it .
On Sunday , the French will try to add a second title to the World Cup it won on home soil in 1998 .
It is an overwhelming favorite now , whoever steps forwards as the opponent this weekend .
Rarely has a team cruised all the way to a World Cup title .
France is one game away from doing so .
Sam Peak Opinion contributor The Trump administration last month confirmed its intent to rescind a policy that allows spouses of highly skilled guest workers to seek employment in the U.S. This would force roughly 105,000 mostly - female spouses into unemployment as they wait years in line for their green cards .
And it would be a big mistake .
The rescission of the H-4 Employment Authorization Document is a part of the presidents " buy American , hire American " executive order , which aims to protect U.S. wages from foreign competition .
But a closer look reveals that H-4 EADs termination would actually damage the nations ability to attract the very talent that bolsters Americas prosperity and economic competitiveness .
The Department of Homeland Security first enacted H-4 EAD in 2015 after realizing that skilled foreign employees sponsored through the H-1B visa were leaving the country because their spouses were unable to work .
Two congresswomen , Democrat Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Republican Mia Love of Utah , mentioned this concern in a May letter urging DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to maintain the program . "
Providing work authorization for accompanying spouses helps U.S. employers recruit and retain highly qualified employees , " they wrote in the letter , which was signed by 130 lawmakers .
Highly skilled couples consider leaving Shortly before the rule was enacted , wait times for Indians , who comprise the vast majority of those classified as H-4 EAD workers , were more than 10 years due to enormous backlogs .
Conditions have not improved .
In May of 2018 , U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services was still processing employment - based green cards from 2008 .
Rescinding H-4 EAD would effectively force thousands of people to endure a full decade of unemployment as they wait in line for permanent residency .
These backlogs are projected to get even worse for future applicants .
According to rough estimates by the Cato Institutes David Bier , Indians applying today would have to wait 17 years to earn an EB-3 visa , the designated green card for four - year degree holders .
But there are tens of thousands more applying for the high priority EB-2 green card for advanced degree holders .
New applicants need not apply , as their projected wait times amount to 151 years .
These backlogs warrant urgent attention , but in the absence of any solution , the H-4 EAD program provides much - needed relief to the victims of these endless lines .

We need to embrace them , not exclude them .
Trump - Sessions immigration policies rip children from parents and shred American values Now with the programs likely demise , families who depend on it are anxiously weighing their options .
In an interview with the Houston Chronicle , Manasa Kokonda said she and her husband can not afford to pay for their new apartment or save for their daughters education if they lose her income .
She works as a software analyst , and her husband is a mechanical engineer .
The Kokondas want to stay in the country and eventually receive their green cards , but if the administration rescinds H-4 EAD , they might decide to move somewhere else .
Silicon Valley software developer Kinjal Zaveri and her family are also contemplating leaving the U.S. Zaveri received employment authorization through the program in 2016 , the same year she gave birth to her second child .
She wants to continue working to help support her family . "
With a single income I do nt think we can afford a mortgage , " she told the Peninsula Press at Stanford University .
These stories illustrate how ending H-4 EAD would put the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage . "
Other countries are modernizing their immigration systems to better recruit and capitalize on high - value international talent , " says Matthew La Corte , immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center . "
Blocking a spouse from working puts U.S. employers at a disadvantage to more generous offers coming from overseas firms . "
America is falling behind in the talent hunt A 2015 assessment by the Business Roundtable , an association of CEOs from Americas top companies , reveals that America is already falling behind , ranking ninth of the world 's 10 most advanced economies for " establishing reliable ways to hire high - skilled foreign nationals . "
The U.S. ca nt afford to lose the very talent that drives much of its economy .
In their research , economists Giovanni Peri , Kevin Shih and Chad Sparber found that from 1990 to 2010 , every one percent increase in a citys share of highly skilled guest workers was met with a seven to eight percent increase in wages for college - educated Americans and a three to four percent wage increase for non - college educated Americans .
In another study from 2011 , economist Jennifer Hunt found that immigrants who entered the U.S. on a temporary visa were substantially more likely to license or commercialize patents than native - born citizens .
In his plan to protect American workers , President Donald Trump is driving away the very innovators and entrepreneurs that enrich the entire nation .
We can only be known as a country that welcomes the world 's " best and brightest " if America remains a place where immigrants see a future for themselves -- and their families .

Samsung Electronics on Friday said its second - quarter operating profit likely rose 5.2 percent from a year earlier , missing analyst estimates .
Its sluggish mobile business pressured strong margins from its chip sales , analysts have said .
Samsung , in a regulatory filing , said April - June profit was likely 14.8 trillion won ( $ 13.2 billion ) , below the 14.9 trillion won average of 18 analyst estimates in a Thomson Reuters poll .
Revenue likely fell 4.9 percent from a year earlier to 58 trillion won .
The firm did not elaborate on its performance and will disclose detailed earnings in late July .
Samsung has boosted the camera capabilities on the Galaxy S9 smartphone , continuing with a similar design to the S8 .
Samsung smartphones are sending users ' pictures to their contacts without their permission , according to complaints by a number of people posted online .
The issue appears to be affecting Galaxy S9 and Galaxy Note 8 users .
One user on Reddit said that the entire photo library on his phone was sent over text to his girlfriend but there was no record of it on his messaging app .
He discovered it had happened via his T - Mobile logs .
Users are reporting that it is an issue with Samsung Messages , the default messaging app on the South Korean company 's devices .
One person on Samsung 's community forum said the messaging app became " very buggy " after an update by T - Mobile for so - called Rich Communication Services ( RCS ) messaging .
This new standard is a messaging protocol between different carriers to help make sending videos and other media easier .
It is aiming to replace traditional SMS messaging .
A Samsung spokesperson told CNBC by email that it is aware of the reports and that the technical teams " are looking into the matter . "
Customers " are encouraged to contact their local customer service team directly , " the spokesperson added .
Later , Samsung updated the statement to say that it had investigated the issue and found that there was no software or hardware problem . "
Samsung has reviewed this matter thoroughly these past few days ; however , there were no hardware or software issues found to be relevant to this particular case .
While there have been no known similar customer reports globally , we will continue to investigate this issue further , " a spokesperson told CNBC by email on Tuesday .
T - Mobile was not immediately available for comment .
But the mobile network did issue a statement to other news organizations saying that " it 's not a T - Mobile issue . "
SAN FRANCISCO - Five years ago at age 16 , Jordan Hicks participated in a youth tournament in Atlanta and attended a Braves game , where he was blown away by the sight of then - Cincinnati Reds reliever Aroldis Chapman repeatedly pumping fastballs above 100 mph .
Now Hicks has replaced Chapman as baseballs premier fireballer .
The St. Louis Cardinals rookie has thrown the three fastest pitches in the majors this season , two of them at 105 mph , and seven of the top 10 .
He leads the majors with 286 pitches reaching triple - digit speed , nearly twice as many as Chapmans 153 , the second - highest total .
Statcast figures indicate Hicks averages the hardest two - seam fastball ( 100.2 mph ) , sinker ( 99.8 ) and four - seam fastball ( 99.5 ) in the game .
Much like Chapman , Hicks began his pro career as a starter and continued to perform those duties until making the Cardinals out of spring training as a setup man , jumping all the way from Class A. MORE MLB NEWS But while the Cuban lefty soon proved himself more adept as an intimidating closer , Hicks future role remains undetermined .
He was climbing the organizational ladder quickly as a starter , going 14 - 5 with a 2.82 ERA in 34 appearances in the low minors , 31 of them starts . "
He s too young for us to destine him for the bullpen .
I think that s still part of the conversation , manager Mike Matheny said . "
We had Trevor Rosenthal here for years getting 40 saves for us and still talking about him as a starter .
Its not something you just abandon .
If he can hold that kind of stuff that he s been showing for us late in the game , if he can hold that for six innings , that s pretty valuable too .
On the other hand , in this age of " bullpenning and game - changing setup relievers like Josh Hader , Andrew Miller and Archie Bradley , potent young arms do nt always wind up in the starting rotation .
Plus , Hicks has developed a taste for the bullpen he did nt know was there before this season . "
I like it more than I thought I would and I ve really adapted well , said Hicks , who s 3 - 1 with a 2.56 ERA and 39 strikeouts in 45 2/3 innings . "
At first I was nt used to throwing every single day , or maybe back to back .
I d never done that before .
But now I feel really good .
The Cardinals , who have the National Leagues second - lowest starters ERA at 3.48 , needed to bolster the bullpen going into the season and took a chance on the inexperienced Hicks in a new role , getting an immediate payoff .
He allowed one run in his first nine outings . "
The guys got a gifted fastball , that s for darn sure , pitching coach Mike Maddux said . "
He s able to do something nobody else can do .
He s got a big advantage over hitters because the only time they see something like that is when they re going against him .
Looking for further bullpen help , St. Louis also signed Greg Holland to a one - year contract shortly after Opening Day , and that move has nt worked .
The veteran closer has struggled mightily to the tune of an 8.27 ERA , blowing both of his save chances before yielding the ninth - inning role .
The Cardinals are tied for the third - fewest saves in the National League with 21 ( in 34 chances ) , part of the reason they re merely hovering over .500 at 46 - 43 .
Though veteran Bud Norris , himself a former starter , has claimed the closer role by converting 17 saves in 19 opportunities , its not hard to envision Hicks handling those duties sometime in the future .
Asked to project his role five years down the road , Hicks said he d want to be a starter or a closer .
He enjoys the adrenaline rush he gets entering late in the game , and the option to go all - out without having to conserve energy for a long stint . "
Its definitely a different feeling because you hear that phone ring and you go , ' Is it going to be me ?
All right , lets go , he said . "
As a reliever I feel like I can go out there and let it eat .
As a starter I can still let it eat , but you still have to know I m going six or seven .
Regardless of his role , batters do nt feel all that comfortable stepping in against Hicks heat , which he combines with a decent slider and enough wildness ( 4.5 walks per nine innings ) to put some fear in their hearts .
In Saturdays eighth - inning outing against the San Francisco Giants , who reached him for a run but could nt tie the game , 20 of Hicks 25 pitches - all but his sliders - lit up the radar gun at a minimum of 100 mph .
Giants second baseman Alen Hanson said that kind of velocity forces hitters to zero in on just the fastball so they can try to catch up , leaving them vulnerable to breaking pitches .
So if he had his druthers , Hanson would just as soon see Hicks join the rotation . "
I d rather face him as a starter because he would nt pitch that same way or have that kind of stuff .
He could tire out and come down to 96 , 97 , Hanson said . "
This way , you may have a starter throwing 91 , 92 , then in the eighth inning they bring in someone like that with that kind of potent arm .
SAN FRANCISCO - From Donald Trump to Barack Obama , the bragging rights of Twitter 's most powerful are about to get seriously humbled .
As Twitter stops counting tens of millions of followers to crack down on fraudulent and suspicious activity , everyday folks will take a hit to their follower counts , too .
But the accounts with tens of millions of followers , the ones that make mere mortals ooze buckets of digital envy for their online popularity , will be in for a world of hurt as Twitter deflates their follower counts .
How much of a decline there will be for Trump , who has 53.4 million followers , and Obama , who has 104 million , remains to be seen .
One thing is likely : A backlash is coming .
Conservatives have complained for years that these kinds of purges unfairly target conservative voices who do n't agree with the political views of Twitter 's largely liberal staff .
For Twitter , this is just the latest effort to restore trust with users .
Follower counts , a key measure of online popularity and influence , should be accurate , it says .
So it made the decision to no longer include Twitter accounts that it had frozen for suspicious behavior in the totals of followers listed on people 's profiles .
As a result , most people will see a drop of four followers or fewer , according to the San Francisco company .
The likes of Katy Perry ( 110 million followers ) and Rihanna ( 89 million followers ) could see their Twitter cred slide significantly more than that as about 6 percent of the total combined follower count permanently vanishes .
The internet has experienced this kind of bloodbath before .
In 2014 , we had the Instagram Rapture , when the Facebook - owned company slashed deactivated spam accounts and other accounts that violated its guidelines .
Distraught users begged the company to stop decimating follower counts as socially media savvy celebrities such as Justin Bieber mourned the loss of millions of followers .
What are these accounts no longer being counted as followers ?
Twitter points to signs the accounts were spam or fraudulent .
It locked accounts after detecting sudden changes in activity , for example tweeting unsolicited replies or mentions , posting misleading links or if the account is blocked by a large number of other accounts .
Twitter contacted the account holders to ask them to verify the account and reset their password .
If the account holders did nt respond , the accounts remained locked .
For CEO Jack Dorsey , cleaning up shady social media practices such as automated bot accounts and the buying and selling of followers is critical to promoting " healthy " conversation on Twitter .
This is his latest volley in an intensifying battle to stem the spread of abuse , misinformation and propaganda that undercut trust in the platform , particularly after revelations that Russian operatives exploited Twitter to meddle in the 2016 presidential election .
Fake followers are n't just troublesome to Twitter , they 're not popular with advertisers .
Last month , consumer goods giant Unilever said it would focus spending on those platforms that made an effort to rid themselves of this kind of " influencer " fraud . "
Our digital ecosystem is being polluted by a growing number of fake user accounts , so Twitters commitment to cleaning up the digital space should be welcomed wholeheartedly by everyone , from users of the platforms to creators and advertisers , " Unilever 's chief marketing officer Keith Weed said in a statement . "
People having an artificially inflated follower count made up of bots and redundant accounts is at best deceiving and at worst fraud . "
Twitter has shaved follower counts before .
It cracked down on bots and fake accounts this year after a New York Times report uncovered substantial follower fraud .
Twitter has 336 million users who log in each month .
Most of the accounts frozen by Twitter for suspicious behavior had not been active in at least a month .
More : Trump supporters , conservatives rage over Russian bot purge , # TwitterLockOut More : Twitter vows new crackdown on abuse after Harvey Weinstein boycott More : Twitter to police abuse in major shift Last week , The Washington Post reported that Twitter would suspend more than 1 million accounts a day , shaking up the company 's stock and getting the notice of Trump , who tweeted , " Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace .
Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon , the Washington Post , who constantly quote anonymous sources that , in my opinion , do nt exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years ! "
SAN FRANCISCO - They were the team once linked the most to shortstop Manny Machado , but now the contender no longer interested in him .
They are the team who once again have World Series aspirations , but the ones barely making a ripple in the trade deadline rumor mill .
The Chicago Cubs , despite being in second place in the NL Central , and relegated to playing the Philadelphia Phillies or Atlanta Braves in a wild - card game if the season ended today , have nt felt this strongly about their team entering the All - Star break since manager Joe Maddon sauntered into town .
Oh sure , their biggest free - agent prize , Yu Darvish , has been among baseballs biggest busts , with just one victory and two months between starts .
Kris Bryant , who is playing these days for the Tennessee Smokies , is expected to rejoin the Cubs on Wednesday .
Jon Lester , sporting 11 wins and a 2.45 ERA on his way to a fifth All - Star Game , is the only starter who can be counted on .
Yet , here they are , believing they ll be playing at Wrigley Field in late October once again , no matter what they do at the trade deadline . "
Were a pretty confident group , Cubs pitcher Mike Montgomery tells USA TODAY Sports . "
We can stack up with anybody in the league , especially with the offense we got . "
I know this front office is aggressive .
We ve added guys at the deadline before , and its worked out well .
If they do something again , great . "
If not , we really believe we can win the World Series with what we got .
MORE MLB The Cubs ( 51 - 37 ) , who are 26 - 16 since May 25 , and have bludgeoned the opposition by a league - leading 104 runs this season , still have to catch the Milwaukee Brewers , who lead them by 1 1/2 games .
Yet , the Cubs consider it more of a formality than an obstacle .
Sure , maybe that confidence wanes a bit if the Brewers win the Machado sweepstakes .
The Los Angeles Dodgers , Brewers and Arizona Diamondbacks are the leading candidates to acquire Machado , a high - ranking Orioles executive said , with the New York Yankees interest overblown .
Yet , you ca nt find a soul in the Cubs clubhouse who seems worried about it .
The only one who ever expressed even the slightest interest in the Machado trade talks was shortstop Addison Russell , but after hitting .329 in June , those trade rumors died before the ivy turned green at Wrigley . "
I tried not to pay attention to it , Russell said , " but it was pretty hard to ignore .
I was pretty confident that the team wanted me here , but there were so many reports and rumors . "
Obviously , Manny is a great talent .
Seems like a great person .
Any team would be lucky to have him .
I m just happy that I m here because this team has a chance to be pretty special . "
I think with our lineup , we can beat any team .
Really , Ill stack us up with anybody .
The Cubs , who lead the NL in runs , batting average and on - base percentage , simply believe that they have too much firepower and depth for the Brewers or anyone else to keep up with them .
Second baseman Javier Baez is an MVP candidate , hitting more homers ( 17 ) than any Cubs middle infielder by the All - Star break since Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg in 1990 , with the most RBI ( 65 ) since Ernie Banks in 1960 .
The Cubs certainly respect the Brewers , along with the contenders in the league , but there s no fear .
Barely even a concern . "
I do nt feel like were chasing anyone , Cubs right fielder Jason Heyward says . "
This team is playing well , and everybody is in a good place .
We went through so much last year , coming off the World Series , but this year , were a lot more fresh and rested .
Were feeling pretty good where we are .
The Cubs were 43 - 45 and 5 1/2 games behind the Brewers at the 2017 All - Star break .
They 'd lost nine of 11 entering the 2016 break , and went on to win the World Series .
Its almost become a Cubs tradition to leave everyone choking on their exhaust the second half .
The difference this time , the Cubs say , is that they ve never felt more confident . "
Actually , if we continue the path were on , Maddon said late Monday night in his office , " it might be the best we felt going into the All - Star break .
Even in our World Series year , we were kind of limping in .
Last year , there was so much fatigue among the guys . "
This year , I m not feeling that .
I m feeling a lot of energy from the guys .
Nobody feels beat up .
It did nt feel like that in 15 , or 16 or 17 .
We ve got a lot better heartbeat . "
The biggest thing now is to get the starting pitching in order .
Well , to be more specific , getting their $ 126 million man to pitch like an All - Star .
Darvishs inaugural season in Chicago has been as ugly as their winter weather .
He has made only eight starts , won once , and has nt pitched into the seventh inning .
He was last seen in uniform on May 20 , and is now playing catch these days trying to rid the discomfort in his right triceps , living up to his soft reputation that was solidly built in Texas . "
We have to get Darvish back , Maddon says . "
That s a big part of this .
Yet , If the rest of the rotation stepped forward , Darvish would nt be such a huge worry .
Tyler Chatwood ( 3 - 5 , 5.01 ERA ) , their other free - agent starter , has walked a league - leading 70 batters in 79 innings .
Kyle Hendricks finally pitched how the Cubs remember on Monday night , when he gave up just one unearned run into the ninth inning against the Giants .
Jose Quintana ( 7 - 6 , 4.22 ERA ) has been solid , but only as a No .
3 or No .
4 starter .
Darvish is the one who holds the key to their playoff fate .
If the Cubs believe he can return , and dominate , there s no need to search for another starter .
They can simply pursue a back - end reliever or a piece for the bench .
If they ca nt trust Darvish , they have no choice but to grab someone who s capable of pitching in a playoff race . "
If we can just get Yu back to his normal form , " says utility man Ben Zobrist , " then well be tough to beat .
Even without Machado .

Sand , surf and snacks Summer is the time to stuff your face full of junk food and ruin that beach body you worked on all winter .
It 's the time to stuff yourself with carbs and sugar while you re basking in the sunshine .
Advertisement Promenades and boardwalks line the New Jersey shore featuring culinary delights that will dazzle even the most experienced junk food fanatic .
Even though many of these choices are classified by US Law as " food with minimal nutritional value , " your taste buds will thank you for the treat nonetheless .
Here are 10 treats that will make your beach vacation complete .
Pizza Prep 's Buffalo Chicken Pizza is our pie of choice -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie The holiest of holy foods .
A great slice of pizza has the magical power to uplift your soul and make pure satisfaction course through your veins .
Pair this perfect delivery system of tomato sauce and cheese with a sea breeze and board under your feet , you have the recipe for beach vacation memories .
At the shore , you 're looking for something with a thin , crispy crust and a slightly sweet and tangy sauce marbled with fresh cheese .
Keep the toppings simple .
Pepperoni , sausage and maybe some veggies .
Funnel cake It 's okay to get messy with funnel cake at the beach -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie Coils of batter wrap round and round , crisscrossing as they sizzle in the boiling hot oil .
Shower that crunchy brown creation in powdered sugar and you 've got yourself a delectable boardwalk dessert .
For this crisscrossing maze of batter and powdered sugar , we have the Pennsylvania Dutch to thank .
First introduced by these lovely German - speaking immigrants , the modern form of of funnel cake took its final form around 1879 .
Pro tip : Funnel cake is best eaten in your bathing suit , so you can simply dive into the ocean to wash off all that powdered sugar that 's inevitably gone everywhere .
Deep fried Oreos Dig into some deep fried Oreos -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie A man who deserves an honorary million Michelin Stars is " Chicken " Charlie Boghosian , the Armenian angel who created the devilish deep fried Oreo .
Deep frying anything has the power to enhance just about any ingredient : butter , Coca - Cola , Snickers bars .
But the Oreo is in a league all its own .
A properly battered and fried Oreo creates the perfect contrast of fluff and crunch .
The crispy outer shell gives way to softened cookie within .
The interior has the consistency of an Oreo dunked in milk , making it a simple delight for anyone looking for a quick shot of sugar and carbs .
Cotton candy I guess you could say cotton candy is a " lighter " snack -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie For those of you with an intense sweet tooth , look no further than a big ol bushel of cotton candy .
Ironically , machine - spun cotton candy was invented in 1902 by a dentist and a confectioner .
It debuted at the 1904 World 's Fair where it quickly caught on at carnivals , circuses , and theme parks across the country .
Since any Jersey boardwalk worth its salt(y food ) features carousels , rides , and fairground games , it was only a matter of time before beachgoers were stuffing their faces with fluffy colored sugar clouds .
Caramel corn Johnson 's caramel popcorn is calling your name -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie A classic of the boardwalk for generations , caramel corn is a required crunchy snack while strolling between theme park piers .
Originating sometime around the 1890s , caramel corn is deceptively difficult to make .
The caramel corn crafter has to expertly regulate the heat of the molten caramel so that it evenly coats the popcorn without scorching the sugar .
The result is a salty , sweet and crunchy mixture that 's perfectly suited to nosh while walking your way to the next skeeball destination .
Water ice Polish water ice is probably the most refreshing treat -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie What could be more refreshing after a long day of riding roller coasters , playing whack - a - mole and walking along the beach than a fruit - flavored cup of icy cold goodness ?
No , not plain old ice water .
Were talking about water ice , that concoction of water , sugar , flavor and technicolor food hues that has been dying tongues and creating sticky fingers ever since it was brought over to the US from Italy .
While many brave vendors have ventured out to create some wacky flavors , we recommend you stick with the classic fruit offerings .
This is another messy treat best eaten in a bathing suit .
Soft serve Kohr Brothers soft serve brings the nostalgia -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie Evoking nostalgia with every lick , soft serve is one of the universal symbols of summer .
It might be the salt air or the pine under your feet , but for some mysterious reason , soft serve tastes so much better on the boardwalk .
The perfect way to beat the heat is with a twist .
You get the best of both flavors - and you 're no longer limited to the simple vanilla and chocolate variation anymore .
Any soft serve joint worthy of a spot along the boards features an array of twists with orange , strawberry and an array of other flavors .
Salt water taffy Shriver 's salt water taffy is the most portable option -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie Originating in Atlantic City around the 1880s , it has long been debated how salt water taffy got its name .
One tale suggests a lazy candy - making assistant accidentally used sea water while making a batch of taffy .
Another account claims a storm surge flushed sea water through a candy store over their trays of taffy .
However it happened , we 're glad it became the signature sweet of the Jersey Shore .
Typically packaged with nostalgic style and care , salt water taffy is always a welcome gift to bring home to those who were n't lucky enough to make it to the beach .
Fudge Do n't miss stopping at Shriver 's for fudge -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie If you 're looking for a snack and a show , walk no farther than one of the numerous fudge shops that dot just about any boardwalk along the New Jersey coast .
This concoction of sugar , butter , milk and assorted ingredients is heated to the soft ball stage , then poured into giant copper vats where someone with an amusing hat and a wooden paddle beats this candy into a creamy texture as it cools .
Curly fries Flavor is found at Curly 's Fries -- Photo courtesy of Chris Urie Flavor is attracted to curves .
That 's a scientific fact .
So according to science , the most delicious french fries would be curly fries .
Cut with a specialized spiral slicer and deep fried to perfection , curly fries have the perfect shape to really soak up their seasoning and deliver greasy , starchy , goodness to many a weary beachgoer .
While your standard salted fries are a classic , we 've seen creative fry purveyors get fancy with the spices and introduce Old Bay and curry powder to their menus .
Sandra Harwitt Special to USA TODAY Sports WIMBLEDON , England - It took nine days of play , but the excitement at Wimbledon finally arrived when the two top seeds were taken the five - set distance in mens quarterfinal matches Wednesday .
Top seed and defending champion Roger Federer , technically ranked No .
2 in the world , did nt survive his enthralling 2 - 6 , 6 - 7 ( 5 ) , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 , 13 - 11 encounter against eighth - seeded Kevin Anderson on Court 1 .
The loss denies Federer a ninth Wimbledon trophy and 21st Grand Slam victory .
Many hours later over on Centre Court , second - seed Rafael Nadal , the No .
1 player in the world , had better fortune .
He came through a thrilling and athletic 7 - 5 , 6 - 7 ( 7 ) , 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 outing against fifth - seeded Juan Martin del Potro in a 4-hour , 48-minute match that neither player deserved to lose .
Nadal claimed the final point with a high backhand volley , which found del Potro landing face down on the ground in an attempt to go after the shot .
Match won , Nadal climbed over the net to embrace del Potro as he got up and then stopped packing his gear bag to applaud along with the crowd as his opponent left the court .
More:13 interesting facts about Serena Williams , her competition in Wimbledon semis More : No .
1 seed Roger Federer suffers stunning upset in Wimbledon quarterfinals " A very emotional match and great quality of tennis , especially fifth set , " said Nadal in a BBC interview . "
I m very sorry for Juan Martin , he s an amazing competitor .
I m very happy .
Its a very important achievement for me to be back in the semifinals here .
Its a day to be happy . "
Nadal is not a novice when it comes to success at Wimbledon , The Spaniards won the title here twice ( 2008 and 10 ) and was in three additional finals .
This year , however , marks the first time he s reached the Wimbledon semifinals since he journeyed to the final in 2011 .
On that occasion , Nadal was defeated by Novak Djokovic , his semifinal opponent Friday .
Indeed , all the attention of the day was on Nadal and Federer , but there were two other semifinalists to also be determined .
The 12th - seeded Djokovic , a three - time Wimbledon champion , moved into the semifinals with a 6 - 3 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 win over 24th - seeded Kei Nishikori .
After a few years of struggling with injury and mindset , Djokovic appears to be back in great form and ready to reclaim his position as a Grand Slam contender .
Charged with the duty of trying to bring the mens Wimbledon trophy home to America for the first time since Pete Sampras won his seventh in 2000 is first - time Grand Slam semifinalist John Isner .
The ninth - seeded Isner captured a 6 - 7 ( 5 ) , 7 - 6 ( 7 ) 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 win over 13th - seeded Milos Raonic to advance to the semifinals against Anderson .
Isner 's quarterfinal win improved his record over Raonic to 4 - 1 .
Interestingly , they ve played 13 sets against each other and nine of those sets have been decided in a tiebreaker , including the two Wednesday . "
Its pure elation right now , " Isner said . "
Very happy to be in this position in the semifinals .
Mentally and physically I feel in a good spot and feel like I can keep doing damage here . "
Sandra Harwitt Special to USA TODAY Sports WIMBLEDON , England -- Angelique Kerber will vie for her third career Grand Slam title after ousting 12th - seeded Jelena Ostapenko 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 in the Wimbledon semifinals on Thursday .
The 11th - seeded Kerber only needed 68 minutes to beat Ostapenko , the 2017 French Open champion .
Kerber captured her first two Grand Slam titles in 2016 -- at the Australian Open and U.S. Open .
In Australia , she upset Serena Williams for the trophy , becoming the first German woman to win a Grand Slam title since Steffi Graf at the 1999 French Open .
At the time , Kerbers victory in Melbourne made her only the fourth woman to defeat Williams in a Grand Slam final .
Since then , Garbine Muguruza joined the list after beating Williams in the 2016 French Open final .
In New York , Kerber downed Karolina Pliskova to win the U.S. Open .
Kerber also played in the 2016 Wimbledon final , which she lost in straight sets to Williams .
Kerber controlled the match , booking her spot in the final when Ostapenko flailed a forehand wide on the second match point in the match .
Kerber will play the winner Saturday of the semifinal between No .
25 Williams and 13th - seeded Julia Goerges .
SANTA MONICA , Calif. - If you were to ask me to describe the Ye Olde Kings Head pub on Wednesday morning , I d tell you it was the perfect , cheeky spot to watch the England v. Croatia semifinal .
Why ?
It serves beer when it opens at 9 a.m. PT , plays World Cup songs before the game starts and its a cozy space where no one frets over a spilled pint .
But if you were to ask me about the same pub on Wednesday afternoon , I d tell you it was a dark , hot , depressing dungeon of tears and sticky floors .
At least that s what Kings Head , the famed pub in Santa Monica that is the home - away - from home for Los Angeles - based Brits and die - hard World Cup fans , became when England went from leading 1 - 0 to losing 2 - 1 in extra time .
It 's one of a number of bars in America that caters to a largely - English crowd .
Their customers might not necessarily invade an IKEA in sports celebration , but would be down to crowd - surf at the bar ( as happened in Kings Head before ) or sing " God Save the Queen " while holding up a replica World Cup in a Freddie Mercury mask ( as has happened in Brooklyns Banter bar ) .
And so , even though USA is n't in the World Cup this year , lines to get into these pubs can run down the block , the bar can reach capacity and a game - heavy day can bring in three different waves of fans .
As King 's Head bartender Raul Dourado says , " Its awesome .
Its ( freakin ) business ! "
But it 's less awesome when England loses .
Here 's what happened Wednesday at King 's Head when Croatia upset the lads .
9:30 a.m. The fight songs commence .
After fans are let in and the bar easily hits capacity ( with wait staff adding velvet ropes to ensure they have a path to and from the bar ) , the singing begins .
The Kings Head playlist includes these English crowd pleasers : " Vindaloo , " The Clashs " This is England , " Monty Pythons " Always Look on the Bright Side of Life " and Chumbawambas " Tubthumping ( I Get Knocked Down ) , " which gets cut off , to boos . "
Three Lions ( Footballs Coming Home ) " is played more than once .
As Londoner Rupert Wilson explains , the song was at first a joke because fans had no hopes of getting to the World Cup finals .
But now , the catchy song has become a serious rallying cry with England competing in the semifinals .
Another tip from Wilson : Do n't pronounce the " H " in " Home " when you sing it .
10:45 a.m. One more cheer before we start .
The crowd starts a double , triple , quadruple - clap " England ! "
chant .
Everyone stands , and many people stay standing . (
Seating is pretty limited . )
I notice there are a few people at the bar who did nt wait in line .
How did they get in ? "
Tip your bartenders " someone who was let in a side door tells me . "
Last time we had a $ 300 tab , because were English . "
The game is about to start and already bartender Raul Dourado is tired . "
This is my last World Cup , " he jokes .
England matches do especially good business , because the fans drink early and often . "
If Brazil was playing , we d be serving a lot of water . "
11:05 a.m. GOAL !
Only a few minutes in and already Kieran Trippier scores on a free kick .
The screams are loud , the jumps are high , fists are pumped and the chants are " Ole , Ole , Ole ! "
followed by , of course , by " Footballs Comin Home . "
11:36 a.m. The mood changes .
The excitement from the first goal is long gone as fans are worried about retaliation . "
They missed three shots ! "
a burly dude says on repeat , then corrects himself : " They missed four ! "
The Irish guy next to me starts rolling a cigarette .
11:47 a.m. Halftime .
There are shouts of relief for the end of the half followed by a mass exodus for the bathroom .
I ask people if they re skipping work to see this midday match . "
I took off three weeks of work for the World Cup , " one woman says . "
I called in sick , " says another . "
I swapped shifts with someone , " a man says .
A few other spectators are traveling , unemployed or otherwise off work today .
This is Los Angeles , after all .
1:10 p.m. Everyones still stressed .
A white - haired man in an England scarf looks like he s about to cry before cussing at the screen .
A disgruntled fan ca nt find a decent path to the bathroom . "
Can I go the the pisser ? "
he loudly asks .
Someone tries to lighten the mood with a cheer : " COME on , EngLAND , " he says in an almost Cockney accent .
1:21 p.m. Someone accidentally turns on the music .
In a bizarre move , an employee seems to accidentally play random pop music that has nothing to do with the game .
Attendees boo the music and then realize , that , wait , did Croatia just score ?
Croatia just scored ? !
The bar goes quiet .
Waitresses are transfixed on the match .
Bartender Raul keeps staring at the screen and petting his beard .
1:38 p.m. Croatia scores again .
Tears come .
It 's over .
Its quiet .
One man puts his head in his hands and keeps it there for a minute .
The place quickly clears out .
There are tears and sad hugs .
Fans walk out of the formerly lively pub , which has become a sweaty room with not enough windows , and brace themselves for the hot sun .
People do nt want to talk .
They re pissed .
At least no one 's fighting .
Someone mocks the fact that I 'm asking questions and sarcastically says he 's going to go home and eat " crumpets and tea . "
But Romero , the woman with the flag , is kind .
After sitting in silence for a few minutes , she speaks : " Being here , amongst all these English people , in L.A. , so far from home , its magical , " she says , still looking toward the TV screen . "
All these English people who care as much as I do , you do nt get that any other time but when its the World Cup . "
Sarah Palin is the latest public figure to be tricked by notorious prankster and film star Sacha Baron Cohen , and she 's not taking it lightly .
Sunday , the British comedian is launching a new half - hour series , " Who Is America ? " (
10 EDT / PDT ) on Showtime , and the seven - episode show appears to target politicians , tastemakers and cultural phenoms - without their knowledge .
Palin was one of them . "
Yup - we were duped .
Ya got me , Sacha .
Feel better now ? "
Palin wrote on Facebook Tuesday . "
I join a long list of American public personalities who have fallen victim to the evil , exploitive , sick " humor " of the British ' comedian ' Sacha Baron Cohen . "
Palin goes on to explain she was duped into believing she would be honoring veterans during a " legit Showtime historical documentary , " for which Cohen " had heavily disguised himself as a disabled US Veteran , fake wheelchair and all . "
Cohen , she wrote , subjected her to an interview full of " disrespect and sarcasm - but finally ( I ) had enough and literally , physically removed my mic and walked out , much to Cohens chagrin . "
Palin , who brought her daughter to the shoot , challenged Showtime to air the footage , but asked those behind the production to donate all proceeds to a charitable group that supports veterans . (
Proceeds may be hard to pinpoint ; Showtime is a pay channel that does not air commercials . ) "
Mock politicians and innocent public personalities all you want , if that lets you sleep at night , but HOW DARE YOU mock those who have fought and served our country , " she wrote . "
Truly sick . "
Palin also accused Cohen 's production team of " purposefully " dropping them off at the wrong Washington airport , " knowing we d miss all flights back home to Alaska . "
Showtime had no comment .
But in Monday 's announcement of the series , network president David Nevins called Cohen " the premier provocateur of our time , but not for the sake of ' gotcha moments .
Behind the elaborate setup is a genuine quest for the truth about people , places and politics . "
Cohen , 46 , previously explored America in the guise of Borat , a sexist Kazakh journalist , and Bruno , a flamboyant Austrian fashion reporter , on HBO 's " Da Ali G Show " and two stand - alone movies .

As we 've visited my brother - in - law and sister many times before in other military bases we showed our valid IDs and this 4th of July was different .
The military police came and arrested my parents and called The Border Patrol , " said Perla .

Savannah is one of the most charming and historic southern cities in the USA .
The coastal city in Georgia has attracted many U.S. residents and Europeans because of its antebellum architecture , cobblestone streets and large parks and squares , all along the water .
In recent years , Savannah has become a popular spot for people seeking second homes .
Many people are buying homes that they can rent out until they are ready to move in once they reach retirement age .
Cora Bett Thomas , founder of Cora Bett Thomas Realty and Associates , says that in addition to its southern charm , Savannah has become a desirable destination because so many other areas surrounding it have also seen a revival .
Within two hours , people can drive to Hilton Head , South Carolina ; Bluffton , South Carolina ; and St. Simons island off the coast of Georgia .
All are known for either their beaches or golf courses .
There is a growing culinary scene .
Art is also important , as evidenced by the prestigious Savannah College of Art and Design .
Road Trip USA : In Savannah , heritage comes in many flavors There are many ways to get to Savannah .
It has a port , and it is not far from the I-95 corridor .
Savannah / Hilton Head International Airport continues to get more flights . "
A New Yorker can get to Savannah quicker than they can get to the Hamptons , " Thomas says . "
Its the gateway ... We ve got golf courses and horse farms .
Its all of a sudden not become one place .
Its this coastal area . "
The median price of homes is between $ 400,000 to $ 800,000 , Thomas says .
Savannah also offers a variety of types of housing -- from condominiums to Victorian homes in the historic district to waterfront properties where you can keep your boat .
It is still affordable for those looking for second homes . "
Its outstanding , the number of New Yorkers and foreigners we have , and they come and they re becoming involved , " she says .
The historic district has been particularly popular among Millennials , those travelers in their 20s and early 30s who are becoming more influential .
They like that they can get around by foot vs. car .
Prices are still relatively affordable .
Thomas says its the most affordable historic district in the country .
Because of its diversity and affordable prices , Savannah has become a hot real estate market . "
Our inventory is low and days on the market are low , " says Elaine Seabolt , founder of Seabolt Brokers . "
A buyer should consider Savannah because while it is growing , it remains a small town feel with amazing history . "
Saving for retirement in a 401(k ) plan is a great choice .
But socking money away and hoping for the best is nt actually a strategy .
A better idea is to have a financial plan to accompany that account .
At least , that s what Fidelity Investments suggests .
The Boston - based financial firm has created a new feature for employers to incorporate into their managed account products for 401(k ) and 403(b ) plans .
The new service , known as Fidelity Personalized Planning & Advice , will have professionals manage the account and create a personalized plan that takes retirement and other goals -- such as a down payment for a home or paying for college -- into consideration .
The world is getting more complex , " said Sangeeta Moorjani , head of workplace investing product , marketing and advice for Fidelity . "
We learned a lot about the trade - offs people have to make , like student loans or needing an emergency savings account . "
The upgrade is free , but companies pay for the managed account service , and they may pass on some of that cost to consumers , she said .
Here 's what most investors get wrong about disruption See : A simple change to your 401(k ) statement could encourage you to save more for retirement Managed accounts are , as the name suggests , managed by professionals or in some cases an automated investment platform , which picks the asset allocation of the portfolio and charges a fee to do so .
The cost varies by plan provider , The Wall Street Journal reported , and is sometimes not worth the extra expense -- managed accounts do nt necessarily mean better returns .
Traditionally , 401(k ) plans use target - date funds , which are passively managed portfolios targeted to a certain year , usually the one the employee will retire in .
That way , over time the asset allocation of the portfolio shifts from risky to more conservative .
How else do these plans differ ?
Managed accounts usually take into consideration personal risk tolerance and savings ratios , according to the Society for Human Resource Management , and cost 0.10 % to 0.80 % more than target - date funds .
Sometimes , plan participants need help though , which is what Fidelity found .
According to a recent survey , 77 % of people said they would like to run their financial decisions by an expert , and 70 % of those who did reach out to an expert felt more confident in their decisions .
Although 401(k ) plans have become common among employers offering retirement plans ( though only 14 % of U.S. employers do , and they re primarily larger companies ) , employees tend to want more financial education around what they re being offered and how to make the most of it , according to a Prudential Financial study .
A majority of employees ( 86 % ) said they wanted help with retirement planning and savings , 83 % said they wanted assistance establishing emergency savings and 78 % said they d like help creating or managing a budget , the survey found .
When employers offer financial education to their employees , they re more likely to make better financial decisions and maintain better habits , according to the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
According to its study , participants with access to an online financial program in the workplace increased their contributions to retirement accounts by an average of 40 % .
Also see : Save $ 1,000 a year , retire with millions Having a financial plan alongside a 401(k ) can make a huge difference in how much that person will end up with when its time to retire , advisers said . "
Just putting money blindly into a 401(k ) is not a recipe for success , " said Thomas Balcom , founder of 1650 Wealth Management in Lauderdale - by - the - Sea , Fla. The plan should consider inflation , taxes and unexpected expenses , said David Bize , a financial adviser at First Allied in Oklahoma City , Okla. " It does nt have to be fancy , " he said .
Aside from potentially miscalculating financial needs in retirement , there s one more risk to simply stashing away money in a 401(k ) without looking at it every once in a while or speaking with an adviser about it , said Karen Van Voorhis , a financial adviser at Sapers & Wallack Advisors in Newton , Mass. " In my experience , having a 401(k ) plan and contributing to it usually lulls people into a false sense of security , " she said .
Say " so long " to Bombardiers CSeries jets .
No , the jet is nt being scrapped , but it is taking on a new name as Airbus cements its new majority stake in the product line .
Airbus is extending its naming convention to the jets , rebranding the CSeries as the Airbus A220 .
The smaller CS100 , which can seat about 120 passengers in a typical configuration , will now be called the A220 - 100 .
The larger CS300 that can seat 130 to 140 passengers in a standard layout will be known as the A220 - 300 .
Airbus new " A220 " designation places its new line of smaller jets from Bombardier below Airbus ' existing " A300 " lineup of jets .
That lineup currently ranges from the A320 family of single - aisle planes that start at about 125 seats up to Airbus ' double - decked A380 superjumbo jet that can seat more than 600 passengers in " high - density " configurations .
In a statement announcing the name aircraft names , Airbus said that A220 aircraft " are fully optimized for the 100 to 150 seat market and perfectly complement Airbus existing ... A320neo family . " "
Everyone at Airbus has been looking forward to this historic moment .
Today , we are thrilled to welcome the A220 to the Airbus family and are honored to see it wearing its new Airbus colors for the first time , " Guillaume Faury , Airbus President Commercial Aircraft , said in a statement . "
I pay tribute to all the women and men at Bombardier and the supply chain who have strived over the past years to bring this fantastic aircraft to the world .
The A220 now enters a new phase in its career with all Airbus resources behind it to further its commercial success worldwide . "
IN PICTURES : First flight of Bombardier 's CSeries jetliner ( story continues below ) Airbus and Bombardier first announced their tie - up last October as Canadian jetmaker Bombardier looked for a resolution to a trade dispute in which the United States threatened tariffs of up to 300 % on the CSeries jets .
The threatened tariffs followed a formal complaint launched by Boeing that alleged unfair subsidies for the Canadian - made jet , which was buoyed by a large order from Atlanta - based Delta .
The United States ultimately confirmed unfair subsidies , but backed off the tariffs because it said Boeing could not prove harm from them .
However , that did nt come before Bombardier sought refuge in a deal with Boeing 's archrival Airbus that would allow U.S.-bound CSeries jets to be assembled at Airbus recently opened assembly line in Alabama .
The deal ended up giving Airbus a majority stake in the CSeries line .
Since then , Boeing has followed up plans to cement its own partnership with Bombardiers Brazilian - based rival Embraer , further extending the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus .
Bombardier and Embraer have traditionally focused mostly on regional jets , but each has introduced new lines of planes that can seat roughly 100 to 150 passengers , depending on the model and configuration .
That new lineup of planes has brought the regional jetmakers planes right up to the cusp of the smallest models offered by Boeing ( the 737 ) and Airbus ( the A320 family ) .
Now , the recent deals have brought Boeing and Airbus - the worlds two largest jetmakers - squarely into the picture .
Until the recent deals , Boeing and Airbus had focused most of their passenger aircraft attention on larger " mainline " aircraft and left the smaller planes to other manufacturers .

Saying that monetary policy " should be a mystery to no one , " Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday made clear the central bank plans to continue raising interest rate at a pace of once every three months , at least " for now . " "
With a strong job market , inflation close to our objective , and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced , the FOMC believes that - for now - the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate , " Powell told the Senate Banking Committee .
Related : Powell testifies before Congress -- live video and blog Krishna Guha , Fed watcher at Evercore ISI said the phrase " hints ... we may not be very far in time and in rate space from the point at which the case for further hikes will be less automatic and the Fed will have to make decisions on a meeting by meeting basis depending on the evolution of the outlook . "
Powell remarks were upbeat .
He said the economy was growing at a " solid pace , " and the unemployment rate was expected to fall further .
Even the recent pickup in inflation , toward the Feds 2 % target , was " encouraging , " he said .
Powell pointed to " good news " in the decline in the unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics .
While wage gains was moderate , " it also tells us that the job market is not causing high inflation , " he said .
Related : African - American unemployment rate moves up from record low At the same time , Powell admitted that trade wars and fiscal policy were key areas of uncertainty in the outlook . "
It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of current discussions over trade policy as well as the size and timing of the economic effects of the recent changes in fiscal policy , " Powell said .
Senators from both parties pressed Powell on the impact of trade tariffs on the economic outlook .
But the Fed chairman refused to get drawn out , sticking with his message that , in general , countries that embrace low tariffs and free trade have better economic outcomes .
Overall , the Fed sees the risks of the economy unexpectedly weakening as " roughly balanced " with the possibility of the economy growing faster than the central bank currently anticipates , the Fed chairman said .
The Fed has already hiked interest rates twice this year to between 1.75%-2 % and has penciled in two more quarter - point moves .
Read : Fed lifts interest rates and aims for two more moves by end of year At the same time , the Fed has a policy in place to reduce its holdings of Treasurys and mortgage - backed securities .
This program " has been running smoothly , " Powell said .
A key challenge for the Fed will be to keep inflation close to the 2 % level , he added . "
We will continue to keep a close eye on inflation with the goal of keeping it near 2 % , " Powell said .
The Fed chairman said that the healthy economy , with a strong job market and inflation near 2 % , could last for several years .
Several factors are contributing to this positive outlook : financial conditions are favorable to growth , the banking system is much stronger than before the crisis and fiscal policy is stimulative , Powell said .
In addition , the outlook for the global economy " remains solid despite greater uncertainties in several parts of the world , " he added .
The yield on 10-year Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.433 % was little changed after Powells testimony , while stocks rallied after his testimony with the Dow Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % closing up 55.23 points to 25,120 .
Asked about the flatness of the yield curve , Powell said he used the measure as a signal for where policy rates are relative to their neutral setting . "
This is consistent with our view that Fed officials have little appetite for significantly inverting the yield curve , " said Andrew Hollenhorst , an economist at Citigroup .
The closely watched yield differential between 2-year and 10-year notes is near the narrowest level since 2007 .
An inverting yield curve is seen by many observers and Fed officials as a accurate predictor of recessions .

SEATTLE -- Sesame Street is taking its beloved , critically acclaimed brand of educational television into the highly profitable world of classroom curriculum -- a move that experts say could open the door for other companies to move into the sensitive learning space with possible influence on children .
Sesame Workshop , the company behind Big Bird and Elmo , and McGraw - Hill Education , a billion - dollar for - profit company known for school textbooks , announced their partnership Thursday .
Both declined to disclose the financial terms for their new line of classroom instructional materials . "
Sesame Workshop probably can be trusted to do this in an ethical way , but the door opens for other companies to do it in a less ethical way , " said Heather Kirkorian , a University of Wisconsin professor who studies the effects of media in young children .
The TV program and Sesame Workshop 's other educational pursuits have long been lauded for their record of helping kids learn , portraying diverse characters and offering sensitivity in addressing childhood experiences .
The new classroom materials include videos featuring social - emotional and literacy lessons delivered by its famous characters and meant to be used at " circle time , " when young children typically gather to sing songs or hear stories .
They also are offering resources for teachers and parents to help reinforce the lessons .
The instructional materials are on the market for children in preschool through fifth grade , and they are expected to be used in classrooms as early as fall 2019 .
Educators now have access to review the materials , but they have n't been piloted in a classroom yet .
They must be approved by school principals and administrators .
Dr. David Hill of the American Academy of Pediatrics , which urges parents to be cautious and selective about screen time for children , said that by age 3 , kids can learn from a limited viewing of high - quality TV programs like Sesame Street but that little research exists on such regular media use in the classroom .
Hill , a pediatrician , said a young child 's brain can not distinguish between programming and advertising , which could raise questions about the precedent that Sesame Street is setting . "
When you introduce a commercial influence on a nonprofit endeavor , I think everyone naturally has some concerns about the tension that ensues , " Hill said .
Sesame Workshop is a nonprofit and would have to invest its revenue back into its educational mission . "
With a proven whole - child curriculum that serves as a framework for everything we do , Sesame Workshop has put children first for nearly fifty years , " said Akimi Gibson , company vice president .
A much - discussed study in 2015 indicated that preschoolers exposed to the show gained immense benefits , which were compared to that of the Head Start program for low - income children , though the authors of that study later rebuked the idea that the show alone could or should replace any actual school program .
The researchers declined to comment on Sesame Street 's latest classroom endeavor .
Sesame Street has been a household brand since debuting in 1969 on public television .
In recent years , it lost federal funding to produce the show and has partnered with HBO .
Its name recognition is so high that it is equally known for its broad array of licensed merchandise , from bibs and backpacks to toys and games .
It has also achieved cult status for its celebrity appearances and satirizing humor that serves as a hook for parents .
Self - reflection can lead to some cold , hard truths -- at least , apparently , when it comes to biotech stock investing .
A new analysis from Cowen Researchs biotech team finds that investors would be better off ignoring -- or even doing the exact opposite of -- the advice of equity analysts .
The worse a stocks rating , the better its performance , on average , in the following year , the report showed . "
We have analyzed the value of sell - side ratings , and whether following them is associated with investment returns , " Cowens analysts wrote in their report Monday . "
Unfortunately ( for our job security and sense of self - worth ) , we find that over the last four years there was an overall inverse correlation between sell - side ratings and rating changes and the performance of biotechnology stocks . "
Each time a stock 's rating was cut a notch , to a hold from a buy for example , it correlated with a 22 percent increase in price , the report said .
The bigger the swing in the rating , the less the sell - side analyst 's opinion mattered .
The larger the jump toward a strong buy , the worse the stock performed , and vice versa when a company was downgraded to a strong sell , Cowen found . "
These data suggest that sell - side ratings are on average contra - indicators , or at best not useful , in predicting biotech stock performance , " the Cowen team wrote . "
We conclude that a non - consensus investment strategy that goes against the consensus sell - side opinion could generate superior returns . "
You have to appreciate their honesty .
Sen. John McCain 's extended absence from Capitol Hill could complicate the confirmation process for President Donald Trump 's new Supreme Court pick , Judge Brett Kavanaugh .
Kavanaugh 's nomination to the high court will need at least 51 votes and with the Arizona Republican still home - bound in his Cornville cabin following brain - cancer treatment , the GOP 's two - vote margin in the Senate is precariously thin , even with tie - breaking Vice President Mike Pence 's presumed support .
Trump 's Monday night prime - time announcement of the nomination of Kavanaugh , a former attorney and top aide to President George W. Bush , would move the high court in a more conservative direction for decades to come .
More : Five things to know about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh More : These six senators could make or break Brett Kavanaugh 's nomination The president described Kavanaugh as " one of the finest and sharpest legal minds " of the modern era and called on the U.S. Senate to move quickly to confirm him .
For the past 12 years , Kavanaugh has served on the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit . "
This incredibly qualified nominee deserves a swift confirmation and robust bipartisan support , " Trump said .
McCain , a high - profile GOP critic of Trump 's , has not been in Washington , D.C. , since late last year .
There has been no widespread public demand for McCain , a six - term veteran and former presidential nominee , to resign as he works through his health challenges , but some on the right have made it clear they would prefer someone more in line with Trump 's agenda in the seat .
McCain can not vote from Arizona , but has otherwise remained engaged with his job , putting out official statements and commenting on Twitter .
It is unclear whether McCain , 81 , would return to the Senate to weigh in on Trump 's selection of Kavanaugh .
With McCain sidelined and Democrats expected to unite in opposition to Trump 's choice , any single Republican senator potentially could bring down a nomination , changing the chamber 's political dynamics a great deal , Georgetown University Law Center professor David Super said Monday .
If that happens , Trump may have to return with a less - ideological choice . "
It moves us potentially closer to a more traditional type of nominee who gets consensus support , " Super said . "
Democrats traditionally have nominated more liberal judges , Republicans more conservative ones . "
Senate President Mitch McConnell 's elimination of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees has eliminated the need for Democratic support and allowed Trump to focus on conservative jurists , he said . "
The president 's nominees have been targeted only at the Republican base rather than the broader segment of the country , " Super said .
McCain 's absence , " puts us back to where they more traditionally were , " he said .
More : Stormy Daniels strips near the White House as Trump reveals Brett Kavanaugh as pick for Supreme Court More : For progressives , there 's a bright side to Brett Kavanaugh 's supreme Court nomination In a written statement , McCain praised Kavanaugh late Monday , saying Trump selected a jurist with " impeccable credentials and a strong record of upholding the Constitution . "
McCain described Kavanaugh as a " fair , independent , and mainstream judge " respected among his peers . "
One of the Senate 's highest constitutional responsibilities is to provide advice and consent on nominations to the Supreme Court , and I look forward to the Senate fulfilling this critical duty through a fair and thorough confirmation process , " McCain said .
Last year , McCain sided with his fellow Republican and voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch , Trump 's first Supreme Court nominee .
Critical senators Assuming McCain remains out , Trump must secure the support of Republican Sens .
Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , both of whom joined McCain and Senate Democrats last summer to thwart Trump 's efforts at torpedoing the Affordable Care Act .
Trump can afford only one GOP defection and still confirm his nominee to the nation 's highest court .
McConnell has said the Senate will vote on Trump 's nominee in the fall .
Richard Herrera , an Arizona State University associate professor of political science , does n't foresee pressure for McCain to return .
Senate Republican leaders likely will have the votes to fill retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy 's seat with Trump 's nominee , he said . "
They ve already decided , probably , that he is not going to be present and I do nt see a scenario in which he would be compelled to be there , " Herrera said . "
He is also a big believer in the Senate 's regular rules of order , and so I 'm guessing from what he has said in the past , he would want the candidate the White House sends forward , to survive a majority vote . "
And if they ca n't , I would think he would be satisfied with that . "
U.S. Sen Jeff Flake , another Arizona Republican with an antagonistic relationship toward Trump , said on CNN Monday afternoon he would attend Trump 's announcement .
Flake said he has found nothing " disqualifying " so far about any of the four finalists , saying they were " certainly strong conservatives . "
More : Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will face anti - Catholic bigotry -- yes , bigotry More : President Trump says he did not discuss abortion with Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh Immediately following Trump 's announcement ceremony , Flake said in a written statement he looked forward to meeting with Kavanaugh and reviewing his record .
Kavanaugh said he would begin meeting with senators on Tuesday . "
As I have said before , approving a nominee who will interpret the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench should be our top priority , " a statement from Flake said .
Kavanaugh , who is Catholic , worked for independent counsel Kenneth Starr during the Whitewater investigation of President Bill Clinton .
He is considered a potential opponent of Roe v. Wade , the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion .
McCain and the Democrats McCain 's absence could give liberals a better chance to avoid what they would view as a bad nominee , but McCain has rarely been an ally for Democrats when it comes to Supreme Court picks .
In October 2016 , when Hillary Clinton , the Democratic presidential nominee , looked headed to the White House and control of the Senate was also in doubt , McCain signaled he would stand ready to thwart her picks . "
I promise you that we will be united against any Supreme Court nominee that Hillary Clinton , if she were president , would put up , " he said in an interview with a Philadelphia radio station .
More : Schumer vows to fight Trump SCOTUS nominee ' with everything I have ' More : Hundreds protest at the Supreme Court after Trump nominates Kavanaugh The next day , McCain 's office clarified that he meant only that Clinton 's history had suggested she would nominate far - left justices , which he would not support . "
There 's estimates as many as three vacancies could be coming over the next three years , " McCain said . "
That can affect us for decades .
So it 's my passionate argument for keeping the United States Senate in Republican hands , as a check and balance to whoever the president of the United States is . "
In 2009 , he voted against confirming Sonia Sotomayor to the high court , though he acknowledged that the nominee of President Barack Obama had the necessary legal background made her fit for the court .
Early in his Senate career , McCain also backed then - President Ronald Reagan 's original pick for the seat that eventually went to Kennedy : Robert Bork .
In 1987 , McCain voted to confirm Bork , a federal appeals court judge painted as an extremist by Democrats and whose conservative legal opinions and loyalty to President Richard Nixon during the " Saturday Night Massacre " made him a hero to some Republicans . "
I believe Robert Bork will be an outstanding justice and contributor to the court , " McCain said ahead of Bork 's ill - fated confirmation vote .

Sen. Tom Carper is the only sitting Democratic senator who voted in favor of Brett Kavanaugh , President Donald Trumps Supreme Court nominee , to be a U.S. Circuit judge in 2006 .
But Democrats do nt need to worry about his defection this time .
The Delawarean , who is up for re - election in November , said in a statement that Kavanaugh has revealed his " true colors " during his 12 years on the bench and has amassed a record that s a " profound disappointment . "
Republicans are calling for a swift confirmation process for Kavanaugh , but Carper said -- even before Kavanaugh was nominated -- that he is nt prepared to move forward on any nominee until a new Congress is elected in November .
He said he is applying the standard created by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who blocked a vote on President Obamas Supreme Court nominee , Judge Merrick Garland , back in 2016 .
McConnell had said he wanted to wait until after the presidential election to " give the people a voice in filling this vacancy . "
Trumps nominee , Neil Gorsuch , ultimately filled the seat left vacant by the death of Antonin Scalia . "
Our presidents 2016 campaign is currently under investigation - an investigation that has led to an ever - growing list of guilty pleas and criminal indictments .
The balance of our nations highest court is at stake , " Carper said in a statement . "
If Leader McConnell insists on rushing this nominee through before the American people can have their say in November , then Judge Kavanaughs judicial philosophy must be thoroughly vetted in the public eye . "

Shaquille ONeal may be best known for his time playing basketball , but the retired NBA star is also a savvy investor and smart saver .
At least he is now . "
My first check , I blew it , " ONeal , 46 , said Friday on CNBC 's " Fast Money . " "
I blew it in like 20 minutes . "
But O'Neal was n't just being careless with his money . "
I bought my mom a car , dad a car , paid off their credit , bought them a house , " he explains .
At the time , O'Neal says he knew he was young and would have more money coming in , and after that first splurge , he became savvier and started stashing more in savings .
O'Neal says his late father , Phillip Harrison , had a positive impact on how he approached his finances .
Harrison , who married O'Neal 's mother , Lucille , when O'Neal was was 2 , was an Army drill sergeant .
Harrison taught him self - discipline -- an attribute O'Neal says is essential for young savers . "
Every time an athlete would do something crazy , I would get in trouble for it .
So my father did a very great job using scare tactics , " O'Neal recalls on " Fast Money . " "

And they go broke .
And I never wanted to be like that .
So even when I was making a lot of money playing basketball , I would come home and see my father , and [ he d ] be like , ' Yeah , but what are you doing with your money ? ' "

An 8-session win streak would be the second longest this year , behind the two nine - session streaks ending June 5 and January 12 .

Shares of Clorox Co. CLX , +1.79 % tumbled 4.3 % in morning trade Wednesday , after Goldman Sachs turned bearish on the consumer goods company , citing " stretched " valuation and earnings risk , given pricing headwinds .
Analyst Jason English cut his rating to sell , after being at neutral for at least the past three years , and slashed his price target to $ 112 - -13 % below current levels -- from $ 127 .
English said he believes the stock 's valuation is " unsustainably high " relative to its peers .
Clorox 's price - to - earnings ratio ( P / E ) is currently 21.11 , compared with the implied P / E for the SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Sector ETF XLP , -0.48 % of 18.18 , according to FactSet .
For earnings , English does n't believe consensus estimates do n't account for continued rising input costs , and likely negative repercussions of the company 's pricing actions .
He believes price increases will lead " decelerating volume growth , " which means Clorox 's pricing power " will likely be constrained despite management 's optimistic tone . "
The stock has gained 2 % over the past three months , while the consumer discretionary ETF has slipped 0.7 % and the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has gained 3.9 % .

Under terms of the deal , the DAVD - HUD prototype will transition to a first - generation operations system in production no later than 12 months from the date of the agreement . "
This is a seismic shift as it paves the way for standardization of our real - time 3D sonar products into this very important market , " said Coda Chief Executive Annmarie Gayle .

Shares of Intel Corp. INTC , -1.22 % are down 1.3 % in premarket trading after Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse downgraded the stock to in line from outperform .
He sees a number of reasons why Intel 's stock is unlikely to outperform peers , including delays for the company 's 10-nanometer transition and the recent resignation of Brian Krzanich , formerly Intel 's CEO . "
Given these delays , the incoming CEO will need to address whether Intel intends to remain a technology leader and resolve some of the apparent execution issues , or be comfortable with generating substantial profits while holding back technology improvements until significant yields are achieved , " Muse wrote . "
Given Intel 's history , we find it hard to believe that it is willing to step back in such a manner - and the right CEO will find a way to push forward . "
In the meantime , Muse is concerned about competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD , -5.85 % , which he said is " in its best position in years , " Nvidia Corp. NVDA , -3.79 % , and others .
Intel shares are up 51 % over the past 12 months , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % has gained 16 % .

Shares of Nordstrom tumbled 3 percent in early morning trading Monday after the stock was downgraded as same - store sales at the upscale retailer 's brick - and - mortar locations decline and its chain of discount stores , Nordstrom Rack , comes under pressure .
Cowen and Co. lowered its rating to market perform from outperform and dropped its share price target to $ 51 from $ 56 and warned that the retailer may need to close up to 10 percent of its physical stores as more consumers shop online .
The stock ended Friday at $ 51.78 , having climbed about 9 percent so far this year .
Nordstrom has a market value of about $ 8.7 billion .
The company 's off - price division , Rack , " remains a work in progress as digital strength has masked weak physical store comps , " Cowen analyst Oliver Chen said in a research note Monday .
He said same - store sales at Nordstrom Rack have declined for the past six quarters , underperforming other off - price rivals like Ross Stores and TJX . "
Meanwhile , both an opportunity and risk is recent leadership turnover at Rack with the re - introduction of Geevy Thomas as President of Nordstrom Rack following the retirement of Karen McKibbin , " Chen said .
Analysts and investors continue to wonder if a premium should be paid above the $ 50-per - share offer that was on the table earlier this year , when the department store chain was trying to go private .
A special committee advising Nordstrom 's board ultimately ended talks with the Nordstrom family about those efforts , after the two parties could n't agree on price .
The Nordstrom family had hoped that , after going private , the company could further its digital investments and focus on realigning its store footprint , sources previously told CNBC .
According to Chen , Nordstrom will likely need to close more stores in the long term , though the retailer does have a " significantly healthier physical store fleet " compared with Macy 's and J.C. Penney . (
Nordstrom has 122 full - line stores and 239 Rack stores , while Macy 's has nearly 700 stores under various banners across the U.S. and J.C. Penny has more than 850 . )
Nordstrom could close up to 10 percent of its stores , bringing its footprint to roughly 110 locations in the most profitable malls and putting the company in a better position to focus on e - commerce , Chen said .
Showing it was more serious about making investments online , Nordstrom earlier this year acquired two digital start - ups -- BevyUp and MessageYes .
The company meanwhile has been testing a store in California without any inventory -- instead , the location , known as " Nordstrom Local , " focuses on experiences .
In New York , Nordstrom just opened up its first store dedicated to men and will open a full - line store , right next door , for women next year . (
It previously only operated Rack locations in the city . )
Nordstrom is holding its analyst day on July 10 , where management is expected to update the financial community on its strategy and any new initiatives .
The company 's stock could pop if executives convince analysts that they can improve sales and profit margins at Nordstrom 's brick - and - mortar stores , Chen said .
Investors will also be looking for any news on the dividend or a new share buyback program , he said . --

Shares of Papa John 's International Inc. PZZA , -1.48 % and Wendy 's Co. WEN , -0.97 % rose late in the trading session Wednesday after a report in The Wall Street Journal said ousted founder and chairman John Schnatter had held talks to merge the pizza company with Wendy 's .

Amidst the current pause for most front - end companies ( i.e. LRCX , AMAT , KLAC ) due to push - outs from Samsung , many investors will likely be surprised by the positive results from ASML , " Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse wrote , referring to the idea that Samsung has delayed equipment purchases . "
As for laterals , this is the first signal that the current memory pause is short - term in nature . "

Late Tuesday , Berkshire said it approved an amendment to its stock buyback program , giving Chairman and Chief Executive Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger more flexibility on deciding when to buy back shares .
The previous program authorized purchases of shares at prices " no higher than a 20 % premium to book value . "
That was an amendment to the original buyback program announced on Sept. 26 , 2011 , the firstt under Buffetts watch , that said repurchases should be made at prices no higher than 10 % of book .
In a clear indication that investors are itching to share in Berkshires bounty , the rally in B shares was the biggest on a percentage basis since coincidentally , Sept. 26 , 2011 , when they soared 8.6 % .
The A shares also enjoyed their biggest gain since Sept. 26 , 2011 .
J.P. Morgan analyst Sarah DeWitt said the new policy , gives Berkshire more flexibility to deploy excess cash , which she said was about $ 86 billion .
She said that cash has been a " large drag on returns , " especially since Buffett and Munger have not been able to find attractively valued acquisitions in an expensive market .
That s why DeWitt said she views the new policy " as a major positive catalyst " for the shares .
She reiterated her overweight rating and B shares price target of $ 235 , which was 18 % above current levels .
The B shares have edged up 1.1 % year to date and the A shares have gained 1.9 % , while the financial ETF has inched up 0.1 % and the S&P 500 has advanced 5.3 % .
Berkshire also disclosed Wednesday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , that Buffett owned 183,285 B shares , or 0.01 % of those shares outstanding , but also 270,644 A shares , or 36.25 % of those shares outstanding , as of July 17 .
See also : Warren Buffett gave $ 3.4 billion away to foundations .
That means Wednesdays price gains have increased the combined value of Buffetts A and B shares by about $ 3.98 billion .
Maybe that will help persuade him and Munger to start returning some of the companys money to shareholders , which has not actually been a priority for the company .
According to Berkshires annual reports , the company has not repurchased any shares since the original buyback program was implemented in September 2011 .
In addition , the company said it has not declared a cash dividend since 1967 .

Short - dated Treasury yields rose on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , as expected , highlighted the need for a gradual pace of rate increases in testimony on Capitol Hill .
His testimony comes after a rise in government bond yields on Monday was propelled in part by a report on retail sales for June that was better than expected , with improvements to prior monthly estimates highlighting domestic economic strength as reflected in improved consumer spending .
What are Treasurys doing ?
The 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.579 % , sensitive to shifting expectations for Fed policy , added 1.5 basis points to 2.615 % , its highest since July 30 , 2008 , according to WSJ Market Data Group .

Powells testimony in front of the Senate Bank Committee indicated that the central bank would keep raising rates at a pace of once every three months " for now , " suggesting that it would remain flexible about monetary policy should conditions change .
The Fed chairman is due to appear before the House Financial Services panel on Wednesday .
The Fed Chairman also expressed confidence in the U.S. economy and appeared assured that inflation would nt run out of control , much ahead of the central banks 2 % annual target .
See : For the first time , Powell says more rate increases are right path ' for now Traders keyed in how Powell shrugged off the question of how the central bank would think about a potential inversion of the yield curve , or the condition in which short - term rates exceed their longer - term counterparts .
A phenomenon that has been an accurate predictor of recessions .
Analysts say Powell is unlikely to shift this hiking path based on the yield curves movements , but that it would remain one of many indicators he would watch .
The top U.S. central bankers second appearance on Capitol Hill comes after the Fed raised benchmark rates in March and June , and as policy makers have penciled in two more interest - rate hikes for 2018 .
Markets expect the Fed to move in September and December .
Beyond , concerns about the economy , Powell admitted that trade wars would remain a risk to the U.S.s economic prospects , but deferred questions about trade policy to lawmakers .
What did market participants say ? "
The state of the debate is should the Fed be reacting to what the curve is doing .
Or should they be following their own forecasts and let the chips fall where they may .
My guess is Powell sits in the latter camp , " said Tom Graff , head of fixed income at Brown Advisory . "
I guess [ Powell ] is not that concerned about inversion or , more importantly , possibly he feels the Fed can do little to affect it .
I totally agree with he can do little to stop inversion when he is inclined to lift rates gradually , " said Tom di Galoma , managing director of Treasurys trading at Seaport Global Securities , in a note .

SILVIS , Ill. -- This weekend signals an early benchmark in Bryson DeChambeaus budding career , as the 24-year - old will play for the first time as a defending champ in a PGA Tour event .
DeChambeau broke through at last years John Deere Classic , reeling off six birdies in his final nine holes to shoot a 65 and finish at 18-under .
He celebrated his first Tour win with tears of excitement and an emphatic fist pump . "
That s something I m still feeling out , " DeChambeau said Wednesday . "
This is only my second day here since I ve been back .
I think as the tournament gets started , it ll be the same . "
As of right now , its kind of hyped up a little bit I guess if you want to say .
A lot people say , ' Oh , you re the defending champ .
Look , its a tournament I want to go out and play well in , and that s all I have to think about .
Not going to think , ' Oh , I have to defend my title or anything like that .
I am just going to go and execute every shot to the best of my ability . "
His profile has soared since .
He clinched his second Tour win at the Memorial in early June , one of seven top-10 finishes this season .
He is sixth in the FedExCup standings and has put himself in good position to make his first Ryder Cup team .
Just as headline - catching as DeChambeaus play has been is his analytical , biomechanical approach to the game itself .
The former physics major -- who uses single - length irons , relies on vector putting and implements a single - plane swing -- has made plenty of noise with his unorthodox methods .
Cameras caught DeChambeau using a drawing compass during the Travelers Championship at TPC River Highlands three weeks ago .
The USGA ruled last week that the compass is illegal .
DeChambeau addressed the decision Wednesday . "
I will say its unfortunate , " he said . "
Its just a reference is tool .
I talked to ( USGA senior managing director ) John Bodenhamer about it quite a bit , couple hours , and we had a great conversation .
The USGA has been really responsive .
We ve had fantastic talks .
I m honestly look forward to working with them on helping make the rules better , more clear .
That was never my intention -- to skirt by the rules or anything like that .
It was just a device I thought had been used for a long time in different fields .
It should nt be an issue .
Its not a distance - measuring device .
Its just a referencing tool . "
So they only did nt think it was legal , and that s fine .
At the same point in time , there is a lot of different ways to go about referencing things .
You know , like I could ice my finger or things like that .

Sinclair Broadcast Group , Inc. will amend some of its previously - announced divestitures ahead of its acquisition of Tribune Media Company TRCO , Sinclair SBGI , -2.31 % announced Wednesday .
The amendments are in response to Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai 's comments earlier this week about his concern that " certain station divestitures that have been proposed to the FCC would allow Sinclair to control those stations in practice , even if not in name , in violation of the law . "
Sinclair has withdrawn pending divestitures of stations in Dallas and Houston to Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation , and plans to request permission to put the stations into a divestiture trust that will be operated and sold by an independent trustee .
Tribune has also withdrawn its pending divestiture of its station WGN in Chicago to WGN - TV LLC , and Sinclair plans to acquire that station as part of the merger deal .
Sinclair shares have fallen 25.9 % so far this year , while Tribune Media shares have fallen 21.5 % .

In May , we listed the 10 S&P 600 small - cap health - care companies that had increased their sales per share the most while also improving their gross margins .
When you see an extreme change in sales or sales per share , its time to take a closer look .
Regenxbio US : RGNX is running various clinical trials , and its revenue for the first quarter increased to $ 132.4 million from only $ 455,000 a year earlier because an amendment to its license agreement with AveXis , which the company described in its May 8 filing .
Enanta Pharmaceuticals US : ENTA has enjoyed a massive increase in revenue from AbbVies US : ABBV sales of HCV regimens that " contain either of the two protease inhibitor products developed through Enantas collaboration with AbbVie , " according to Enantas earnings press release for the quarter ended March 31 .. A companys gross profit margin is its sales , less the cost of goods sold , divided by sales .
It does not factor in overhead .
If a company is being forced to maintain or boost sales by discounting , the gross margin will decline .
It is a good sign to see a companys margin holding up or improving when sales are increasing rapidly .

Some street art in Chicago is shedding light on the challenges millions of us face every day .
Let 's take a stroll with Dean Reynolds : This summer in Chicago beacons of hope have sprouted on the sidewalk , dotting Michigan Avenue 's " Magnificent Mile " with a message for the masses .
Erecting the lighthouses along Michigan Avenue in Chicago .
CBS News " Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see , " said Janet Szlyk , president of the Chicago Lighthouse , a social service organization which works on behalf of the visually - impaired , physically or emotionally challenged , and military veterans .
The lighthouses are part of a campaign by Lighthouse to illuminate and celebrate the potential of people with disabilities .
Many of the 51 lighthouses on display are works of art created by those whom fate has tested , such as artist Pooja Pittie . "
Focus on what you can do , not what you ca n't do , " she told Reynolds .
Her muscular dystrophy has not impeded her brush strokes .
Describing her painted lighthouse , Pittie said , " It 's called ' Boundless . '
And to me , that word , it just evokes a world full of possibilities . "
A phone app provides information on the works and the artists .
Reynolds said , " It must give you a great sense of accomplishment . " "
Every day , " she said . "
Every day I show up at the easel and paint , I feel that . "
The lighthouse " Sailing Chicago Harbor " by Jeff Hanson , an artist who has been visually impaired since childhood from neurofibromatosis .
His signature style , he said , is heavily textured , using " thick gobs " of high contrast colors . "
My low vision drives me to paint this way .
It 's not a disability , it 's an ability of mine . "
CBS News Szlyk said , " They feel empowered .
That 's the key word : empowerment . "
About half of the artists showcased in the exhibit are living with disabilities . "
It really highlights Chicago as a city of inclusion , " Szlyk said .
Chicago has a history of similar street displays - cows one summer , police dogs during another .
These lighthouses carry messages .
Erika Vessana 's piece is called " Blindfold Brushes . "
And passersby can see what it 's like to not see .
Passersby can experience what it is like to paint artwork without vision , CBS News " Rise Up " is another work . "
Rise Up . "
The Chicago Lighthouse " It 's about people with disabilities installing a light bulb into the lighthouse , " said the artist , Francisco Ramirez . "
They are all reaching up in some sort of way , to be a beacon . "
Ramirez says it shows disabilities ( such as his bipolar disorder ) are speedbumps , not roadblocks .
Szlyk said , " So often I hear of people who have great resumes , great education , great credentials , and they go for an interview , a first interview , and do n't make it to a second interview because of an obvious disability .
We are talking about tens of millions of Americans who could be in the workplace , but are somehow not making their way in . "
The Chicago Lighthouse is trying to change that .
It already has a workforce that produces clocks for the home and office ; and hundreds more work at call centers it runs , underlining the point that the disabled can be productive .
The irony of this new campaign is that some of the artists obviously ca n't see their own product .
Carlos Hranicka has significant vision loss , but nonetheless helped to create a tapestry adorning one of the pieces .
He hopes people who see will think .
Carlos Hranicka of Friedman Place Weavers created tapestry for the artwork titled " Our Woven Lighthouse . "
CBS News " They 'll have a second opinion about what kind of talents disabled or blind or visually - impaired people have , " Hranicka said .
And what better way to show it .
When asked if this exhibition might be the beginning of lighthouses all over the world , Szlyk said , " I would be thrilled if this started a trend that spread all over the world . " "
Shining a light into the darkness ? " "
Yes . "
The lighthouses will be on display through August 11 .

Sordid tales of Hollywood horrors past continue to spool out , the most recent from Oscar - winner Mira Sorvino who says she lost roles for refusing to submit to sex in exchange , and once was gagged with a condom during an audition when she was 16 .
In an interview for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association 's podcast In Conversation to promote her new projects , including the Audience Network 's drama series , " Condor , " Sorvino , 50 , talked about Harvey Weinstein 's criminal case , her regrets about working with Woody Allen , how Hollywood and the country have changed since the # MeToo movement she helped spread , and her activism in pushing for legislation in California aimed at countering sexual harassment and abuse .
The mother of four also expressed dismay about the Trump administration 's immigration policies , especially separating kids from their parents at the border .
Sorvino was among the first accusers of Weinstein , the fallen movie mogul ( now under criminal indictment ) she says blacklisted her from future roles for resisting his advances .
Now she 's continuing to speak out about the casting - couch mentality that ruled Hollywood in her youth .
She said she lost multiple roles because she would n't jump on the couch when demands were made by directors or casting agents . "
Directors pressuring you to have relationships with them , people casting you saying if you have a sexual relationship with them they ll give you the part , " she said . "
That has happened to me several times ... I ve had friends who were told , ' You re going to absolutely have to have sex with all kinds of people to advance your career . "
She always refused and lost out on roles as a result , she said .
She directly accused a major Oscar - winning director she described as " known for his social justice profile " but would n't name him or his movies or when her encounter with him happened . " (
He ) literally said to me at a very end - stage audition meeting , ' You know , as I look at you my mind ca nt help but traveling from the artistic possibilities to the sexual . '
I think my mouth just opened and my silence was deafening , " she recalled .
She refused to go along . "
I know for a fact that 's why I did n't get that part . "
Her most shocking story involves an audition for a horror movie when she was 16 and not yet old enough to fully understand how Hollywood worked .
She says she was treated " inappropriately " by a casting director at an audition for a horror movie .
She says he tied her to a chair , bruised her arm and gagged her . "
And I was all game because I 'm trying to be scared for the scene , " she said . "
And at the end , he takes the gag out of my mouth and he says , sorry for the prophylactic ... That was one of my introductions to how the acting system works . "
At that age , she did n't question much .
She assumed she had to be tough , she had to be " down to really perform . "
She did n't realize the abusive nature of the " acting system " until much later . "
I was too young to even know , thank God , what a condom tasted like .
It was so inappropriate , and what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket in an audition ? "
Sorvino , who won an Oscar for her role in Allen 's 1995 film , " Mighty Aphrodite , " now wishes she had looked further into the allegations against him by his daughter Dylan Farrow , 33 , who accuses her father of molesting her when she was 7 . (
He has vehemently denied this .
Her allegations were investigated years ago ; charges were never filed . ) "
I have since gotten to know Dylan and I believe her , " Sorvino says . "
She s a wonderful person and I think she s been maligned for a long time ... We ca nt just wish away with cognitive dissonance the fact that our heroes are capable of doing something heinous , and ( Allen ) was my hero . "
Sorvino said she recently visited the U.S.-Mexico border with other activists and celebrities including Lena Dunham and Sia .
She said she was horrified by the " shameful " conditions at the detention centers where parents and their children have been separated . "
I know people do nt like it when you make equivalencies between things that happened in the Third Reich but there are certain parallels that ca nt be denied ... our constitutional democracy is eroding , " she said .
But she said the # MeToo movement , joined by " millions and millions , " is helping to change attitudes in Hollywood and the culture at large . "
All of a sudden everyone in the general public realizes the problem is so much more widespread than anyone ever thought because no one would ever talk about it , " due to fear and embarrassment . "
It 's a horrible memory and most ( victims ) would like to keep it secret if they had their druthers , but because of this movement so many survivors are finally letting this out into the light and they 're joining this community that says no more of this . "
South Africa 's Kevin Anderson defeated American John Isner in a marathon five - set match that ranks as the second longest in Wimbledon 's storied history .

Spoiler alert !
The following deals with a pivotal scene in " Eighth Grade . "
Bail now if you do n't want to know the details .
NEW YORK - " Eighth Grade " is the scariest film of the year , in more ways than one .
For those of us who remember having more acne than friends in junior high , Bo Burnham 's poignant coming - of - age comedy ( in theaters now in New York and Los Angeles , expanding nationwide throughout the summer ) will feel all too real .
But there 's one scene that has nothing to do with mean girls or lame dads that proves most frightening of all .
It comes in the movie 's last 20 minutes , after endearingly shy eighth - grader Kayla ( Elsie Fisher ) gets a burst of confidence when she befriends high school senior Olivia ( Emily Robinson ) during a school event for incoming freshmen .
After they hang out with a group of teens at the mall , Olivia 's friend Riley ( Daniel Zolghadri ) offers to drive Kayla home - a seemingly innocuous gesture that neither girl thinks twice about .
More : ' Eighth Grade ' is the most painfully relatable middle - school movie ever Related : How common is sexual misconduct in Hollywood ?
It 's only when Olivia is dropped off that things turn sinister , as Riley pulls over to the side of a quiet neighborhood street and hops into the backseat with Kayla .
There , he instigates a dread - inducing game of truth or dare : He gradually asks Kayla , who is four years younger , how far she has gone sexually , before taking off his shirt and urging her to do the same .
Staring down at her lap and visibly shaken , Kayla refuses and Riley begrudgingly returns to the driver 's seat , where he berates her .
The scene inspired impassioned reactions during screenings of " Eighth Grade " at both Sundance Film Festival in Park City , Utah , and BAMcinemaFest in Brooklyn , where audience members squirmed and yelled at the screen . "
It 's what people do in a horror movie , " Burnham says . "
It 's exciting to see it play for an audience so incredibly tensely , because it did nt play that way on ( set ) .
We approached it sensitively , but we did nt know it would be ' the ' scene of the movie . "
Burnham , 27 , wrote the script three years ago , long before a wave of sexual harassment allegations across industries ignited the # MeToo movement last fall .
For the comedian - turned - director , Riley 's inappropriate advances are about emotional manipulation : After Kayla turns him down , Riley guilts her by saying that " I was trying to help you " and that high school boys will make fun of her for being sexually inexperienced .
Feeling ashamed , Kayla apologizes profusely and bursts into tears at home .
Related : How minor incidents of harassment create toxic environments for women " I have people tell me all the time , ' I m so glad that scene did nt go where I thought it was going to , ' " Burnham says . "
But it does nt need to in order to be emotionally violating for her .
I wanted to portray a moment that , when described after the fact , does nt sound like a big deal but actually is when you sit there and experience it with her . "
That scene takes a turn where her anxieties ca n't just be dismissed by an adult as : ' Oh , you re in eighth grade .
Nothings really happening to you . '
Significant things happen at ( that age ) that can really traumatize kids . "
Fisher , 15 , says she understood the weight of the scene when she shot it last summer , although it was n't as uncomfortable as it appears in the movie .
She had the script sitting in her lap , and Robinson hid in the front seat to cheer her on in between takes .
Despite the film 's R rating , the actress hopes young people will see " Eighth Grade " and feel empowered by Kayla saying " no . " "
You do nt have to do things you 're uncomfortable with , regardless of whether you re a confident person or not , " Fisher says . "
You can still speak your mind , especially in that kind of situation . "
Squabbles over a government contract may prevent low - income families from having easy access to farm - fresh fruits and vegetables .
At issue : The ability of low - income Americans on government assistance to use their Electronic Benefit Transfer ( EBT ) cards to buy food at farmers markets .
Farmers markets have to be equipped to accept the EBT cards .
If markets are not able to operate devices that can handle EBT payments , vendors must use manual paper vouchers instead .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement released Saturday that the Food Assistance Program is " committed " to encouraging farmers market participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) -- also called food stamps -- to improve access for low - income Americans while supporting economic opportunities for farmers and producers .
Congress has approved $ 4 million each year so the USDA can provide EBT equipment to markets and farmers , the USDA said .
It previously worked with a third - party technology company called Novo Dia .
But in November 2017 their agreement ended and , as of this month , they wo nt provide support to the markets that used their technology . "
The Food and Nutrition Service was recently informed by a major provider of mobile EBT technology for farmers markets and farm stands that it will discontinue this service , " Brandon Lipps , the administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service , which is part of the USDA , said in a statement . "
With few providers in this marketplace , this is of great concern .
Farmers markets play an important role in providing Americans with access to nutritious foods . " "
Since being notified of the providers decision to discontinue service , USDA has been exploring all available options in an attempt to avoid a service disruption , " Lipps added . "
Our number one goal is to mitigate the impact on our program participants as well as farmers and producers . "
The USDA did not name Novo Dia , but the companys CEO confirmed that it has previously worked with the government on farmers market SNAP payments . "
There have been long , ongoing conversations about this , " Josh Wiles , the president of Novo Dia , told MarketWatch in reference to recent statement by the Food and Nutrition Service . "
This is not something they just found out about . "

For its part , the Food and Nutrition Service said it would continue to work with interested mobile payments providers , " while seeking to modernize the approach by employing a bring - your - own - device model for accepting SNAP " and other assistance programs .
States must provide point - of - sale equipment to do that , according to the USDA .
Civil Eats , a food policy site , reported last month that farmers were concerned about losing SNAP income from customers at farmers markets .
And last week , the Washington Post reported that a large percentage of people who currently pay for products at farmers markets by SNAP will no longer be able to do so because the markets wo nt have the appropriate technology after July 31 .
Some 7,377 farmers markets were set up with the technology to accept SNAP benefits in 2017 , according to the USDA , more than double the 3,214 that could do so in 2012 .
In New York alone , there are about 20,000 SNAP recipients who shop at farmers markets , making 60,000 transactions a year , according to GrowNYC , an organization that hosts farmers markets .
Those markets may give low - income shoppers access to fresh produce .
A 2009 study by the nonprofit Project for Public Spaces , the nonprofit Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Columbia University , found that 60 % of farmers market shoppers in low - income neighborhoods said the market had better prices than the grocery store . (
They did not specify how many people participated in the survey . )
Another study found similar results , according to the Farmers Market Coalition , a nonprofit group .
Of 216 shoppers surveyed at the Janesville , Wis. , Farmers Market in 2012 , 98 % said they would eat more fruits and vegetables as a result of their SNAP benefits and 30 % said that they had not shopped at the market before SNAP benefits were accepted .
ST .
PETERSBURG , Russia -- Pamela Anderson secretly arrived at the World Cup on Tuesday to watch her boyfriend , who is a member of the French national team take on Belgium in the semifinals , according to a person close to the actress .
The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity due to privacy concerns on the situation .
Anderson , 51 , has been dating French defender Adil Rami since the pair met at the Monaco Grand Prix in May 2017 .
Anderson landed in Russia wearing a diamond Cartier Panther ring , and the person hinted to USA TODAY Sports that Anderson and Rami will soon be announcing they are engaged to be married . "
I expect big things on the horizon from them , " the person said .
Anderson , the former " Baywatch " star who is part Russian , was keen to avoid taking focus away from the French team in its bid to add its second World Cup title .
Instead of sitting with the other player wives and girlfriends she was ushered to a VIP lounge , where French President Emmanuel Macron and the Qatar royal family were also situated .
Anderson has become a soccer fan since her and Rami became serious , and was seen at his games for Marseille in Frances Ligue 1 last season .
While still acting , Anderson is also a passionate and outspoken advocate for animal rights and has campaigned extensively for an improvement in their treatment internationally .

Stock market bulls got some unexpected good news on Thursday .
It was nt that the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , -1.83 % is at a record level .
Its that the Freight Transportation Services Index hit a new high .
Freight Transportation Services ?
Few investors pay attention to the data - release schedule for this index , much less even know about it .
But its status as a leading economic indicator rests on a strong statistical foundation .
The Freight Transportation Services Index measures the volume of the movement of freight by U.S. transportation companies .
It is calculated by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics within the U.S. Department of Transportation .
The index is updated monthly , and the most recent figure , reflecting data for May 2018 , was released Thursday morning ; the index registered its third new high in the past four months , and is up 6.4 percent% over the trailing 12 months . "
Downward trend changes in the Freight Transportation Services index have , at least over the past three decades , led economic slowdowns . "
Why does this matter ?
According to research conducted by the Bureau , downward trend changes in the Freight Transportation Services Index have , at least over the past three decades , led economic slowdowns by an average of four to five months .
That may not seem like a long lead time , but keep in mind that its rare to find indexes that are reliable coincident indicators , much less leading ones .
Read : The stock markets next step could tip the balance toward bears -- or bulls The accompanying chart also plots a companion index that reflects passenger transportation in the U.S. , as well as a combined index which reflects both the freight and passenger versions .
Even though these other indices do nt boast quite as good a track record as a leading economic indicator as the freight version , their record is decent .
And , as the chart shows , each of these other two measures is also at an all - time high .
It stands to reason that the freight transportation sector would be a leading indicator , of course .
If the economy is about to grow more slowly , or turn down , expect freight companies to be among the first to exhibit weakness .
Ethereum co - founder : Blockchain - based wallet could end need for banks That the sector is not showing any early - warning signs of such weakness is particularly significant right now , given widespread worries about an imminent trade war with China and other major U.S. trading partners .
The freight transportation sector can be considered a " canary in the coal mine " when it comes to the likelihood of such a trade war , and so far the canary seems to be doing just fine .
To be sure , the latest Freight Transportation Services Index reading does nt amount to a guarantee that the U.S. economy in general , or the stock market in particular , is on solid ground for the foreseeable future .
Perhaps the best way to think about it is by asking a rhetorical question : If the economy and stock market are about to head over a cliff , why has nt this shown up among freight - transportation companies prospects ?

Unemployment , however , rose slightly to 4 percent from 3.8 percent .
Wage growth also missed expectations , climbing 2.7 percent on a year - over - year basis .
Economists expected growth of 2.8 percent . "
The unemployment rate went up for the right reason : more people coming into the work force , " said Eric Souza , senior portfolio manager at Silicon Valley Bank . "
It was a good report , but what would 've made it a great report is if we saw wages rise a bit more . "
The jobs report comes a day after the Federal Reserve released a summary from its most - recent meeting .
The minutes showed some officials were concerned that " a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures . " "
A strong June labor report , coupled with upward revisions for April and May , gives the Fed a solid rationale for continuing with rate increases this year , " said Quincy Krosby , chief market strategist at Prudential Financial . "
Nonetheless , wage growth remains stubborn , and the potential for an enduring trade war could -- and perhaps should -- give the Fed reason for pause . "

Streaming device and software maker Roku Inc. is breaking into new hardware that includes wireless speakers , a TV voice remote and tabletop voice remote .
The new offerings , announced Monday morning , fit into the companys broad strategy of using its hardware line as a customer acquisition tool -- a means to attract new users and then encourage them to spend more time streaming content .
Roku ROKU , -8.73 % executives have repeatedly said that the companys future route to significant profit is through its platform , as it builds an ads- and licensing - based business .
See more : After booming IPO , Roku thinks this is the future of the company " We see increasing engagement with TV , people are streaming more and they re using their Roku products to consume more content than the year before , " Rokus general manager of TV and players Chas Smith said . "
Its a bet from us that by making the TV more engaging , people will use it more and they ll be more interested in what they watch . [
The new hardware ] will give them a higher satisfaction and it drives our platform business . "
Rokus new speaker hardware bundle is designed to work only with TVs that use Rokus operating system -- manufacturers pay Roku to license the platform .
The speakers will not work with the companys line of streaming dongles and boxes , executives said , which Roku has been cutting markups on to acquire customers .
Roku declined to say whether the company will produce the new hardware at a profit , but Smith did say that there was no change from Chief Executive Anthony Woods earlier statements that hardware would continue to add to the companys bottom line .
For the first time in 2018 , Rokus " Platform " revenue -- which also includes advertising and other revenue -- exceeded its hardware sales .
Do nt miss : The man who gave us the DVR says Roku is the future of TV The Roku TV Wireless Speakers use Rokus Connect technology that gives " tight audio - video " synchronization with the Roku - powered TV , and the only cord required is one for pushing power to the speakers .
The tissue - box - sized speakers also support Bluetooth , which will let consumers stream content from their mobile phones and tablets .
The tabletop voice remote , called Roku Touch , is about the size of one of Amazon.com Inc.s AMZN , -1.81 % Echo Dot devices , though unlike the Dot , Touch requires a person to push a button to activate its voice assistant .
Like the voice remote , the Touch is battery powered by two AAs that should last about six months , Smith said .
Roku announced its new voice assistant product in January , and said at that time it would also seek to license it to other speaker manufacturers .
Roku will begin selling the new gadget package on Roku.com at a preorder price of $ 149.99 until July 24 ; $ 179.99 until Aug. 15 ; and $ 199.99 after .

Susannah Hutcheson Special to USA TODAY Our series " How I became a ... " digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people , finding out how they got to where they are in their careers .
Editors note : This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity .
At 26 , Savannah Sellers career is on fire .
The young journalist , an Emmy winner and the host of NBCs Snapchat show " Stay Tuned , " has made her way up from intern to executive assistant to NBC correspondent .
USA TODAY caught up with Sellers to talk about everything from Beyonce to doing more than your job description and trusting in your path .
Q. What s the last book you read ?
A. It was something I just read for an interview .
I just interviewed this amazing young woman who went through what s called conversion therapy - she came out to her Mormon parents that she was gay , and then they sent her to conversion therapy , where she was basically forced to wear a backpack filled with rocks and face a wall .
Her book is called Saving Alex : When I was 15 I Told My Mormon Parents I Was Gay , And That s When My Nightmare Began .
If I m interviewing somebody and they have a book , I always read it before the interview .
Q. What are your favorite songs for a busy day ?
A. " Run the World ( Girls ) " by Beyonce , and I m a huge Taylor Swift fan .
I just am . "
Ready for It " is a good one - I like the remix .
Q. What is the coolest thing that you ve ever done ?
A. I won an Emmy , which was the wildest thing ever , and I just think it will always feel like that .
It was for a story I was working really hard on , and it was technically when I was still an assistant to two correspondents , but they let me work on the series about heroin addiction as a producer .
It was one of the first things I did , and then I ended up winning an Emmy , which is so cool .

Savannah Sellers : There s a couple .
Of course , who does nt say their parents , because they taught you to do everything first ?
I was the first person in my family to go to college , and you would not know that meeting my parents .
They re the hardest workers .
My dad owns a business , its a software company , and their capacity for empathy - really , like my dad is so emotional , will cry at any commercial that has to do with a little girl - has completely informed the way that I interview people , the way that I sort of connect with people .
My first job , I was the assistant to two correspondents , one of whom was ( NBC TV journalist ) Harry Smith , and he s just the best .
He s stuck with me , he s still somebody I go to for advice all the time , he taught me how to write , he let me travel the country with him , he s one of the best writers in the business .
He s just so fantastic , and for having been in this industry for so long , he is so willing and has pushed me to take risks in my career , like with Snapchat .
I went to him when this offer was coming up and was like , " what do you think ?
Should I do this ? "
He s not on Snapchat and , you know , he pushed me to take a risk like that and always said that those are the kinds of things that you re remembered for .
And Phil Griffin - I was also his assistant , he s the president of MSNBC - and not only has he been such a guide for me and helped me navigate this whole industry , but for someone who s as successful as he is as an executive , you meet him and he s just a human .
You know he s a husband and a father before you know anything else about him .
Learning from somebody who has had that success , who stays so normal and real like that , has just been the coolest experience .
Q. What does your career path look like , from college to now ?
A. Its unconventional , I d say that s for sure .
NBCs the only place I ve ever worked , with the exception of a quick stint at a place called zpizza and a summer at Barnes & Noble .
Other than that , every internship , everything has been at NBC .
Sellers : Right out of school I joined the NBC Page Program here in New York .
Its the coolest experience , the wildest experience .
Its these crazy - smart kids who are all interested in doing the same thing , who for the most part have just moved to New York and they re getting to run around 30 Rock and work " Saturday Night Live"and " Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"and ride elevators with celebrities , and you re like , " What is happening with my life ? "
You come here and it just fires you up to kind of figure out how to stay here .
So , for me , I always wanted to be on - air , and the more typical way to do that is to go through local markets and then work your way up to a market like New York or to be in national news .
I came here and joined the Page Program .
I had interned in New York the summer before , and I just did not want to leave this city or this building .
So I basically just tried to commit to figure out how to get what I wanted without leaving this building .
There were years where I thought , I should just figure out something else to do , but , you know , it ended up working out .
Each step of the way has unknowingly led so well to the next one .
My first job after the Page Program was the assistant to Kate Snow and Harry Smith , two ( NBC ) correspondents .
They re both fantastic .
I just told you about Harry , same with Kate - she s so smart , she s the anchor of Sundays nightly news .
The two of them were such good guides for the beginning of my career because they did not care that my title was assistant , and they did not care that I was 22 years old .
They let me travel the country with them .
It was Kates heroin series that I was the producer on and won the Emmy for .
The thought there was kind of like , " If I want to be on - air , working for these two people who are on - air seems like a good next step . "
Every step of the way I was wondering if I should leave and go into local , but was also like , this is going to lend itself to that goal I have in the end .
After that job - which was only a yearlong job like many first , entry - level jobs are - I became the executive assistant to Phil Griffin , who is the president of MSNBC .
In my interview with him we totally hit it off .
He is like a father figure to me , and he made me feel the whole time like he wanted me to get from that experience what I wanted in a corporate place - to work for somebody and genuinely feel like they ve got your back .
For me , a litmus test also for always kind of figuring out if a decision was right , is " is this something that I do nt already know how to do ?
Am I going to learn something ? "
And being on that side of things : seeing the executive side ; being in meetings ; watching how the business side works ; understanding how we market things ; how you stack a lineup on a cable news network .
Now I have this holistic understanding of the industry because of that , those two , two and a half years that I was with him .
During that time I basically started doing a bunch of digital projects on the side .
I was always trying to do something else at the same time while being an assistant .
Then , what really happened was in January of 2017 , right after ( President Donald ) Trumps inauguration , MSNBC extended their weekend programming hours .
Yvette Miley is senior vice president at MSNBC - she s also a mentor of mine , an incredible woman - and she was sort of like , " If you want to start contributing on the weekends or doing all this digital stuff , now we ve got more time , and on the weekends we could always use extra content . "
So I basically started being an executive assistant weekdays and then MSNBC reporter on the weekends .
It was this crazy time of working every day and feeling kind of like I was always putting together a little school project or something , running around trying to get help from every corner of the building .
It taught me things I did not know how to do , introduced me to the editors who work here : I learned how to track packages , and it was a whole new set of skills .
Seven months later , NBC launched the Snapchat show , and I think the fact that I had been on - air helped me be a better candidate for the position .
The way that that job came about was NBC News basically did a casting call .
They emailed all of the news group employees , which is about 2,000 people , and just said , " Does anyone want to host something digital ? "
It was very big because it was still under wraps that we were launching the show with Snapchat , and then I just applied through the video portal .
I think 500 people initially applied , and then they whittled it down and then I won the contest .
The Snapchat show started , and then everything totally changed .
I d been doing stuff on - air , but the fact that my technical job on paper went from being executive assistant to whatever it is now , it was wild .
Its opened so many doors , and now I m 26 years old and they re letting me on " The Today Show " and I m pitching stories and they re green - lighting them , and its been really cool to work at a place that s so interested in digital endeavors and what I bring as a younger person -- and a lot of people that work here -- to our programs .
Q. What does a typical day look like for you ?
Sellers : If I m in New York , we have a morning call around 9 or 9:30 , depending on other meetings in the morning .
So I do the morning call , and then I go to hair and makeup , - which is the best part of the job - and then I go over scripts .
We have a team of about 25 people or so .
A script is assigned to a producer , they write it , and then my senior producer re - writes it , and then I look over it .
So I m looking for things to put it more in my voice ; or if I was the one who said I really wanted to do the story and I know there s a couple details in there that I want , Ill make sure are in there ; or Ill flip the order to either bury the lede or decide not to bury the lede because I want to use certain video up at the top of the piece .
And then we go up and have a taping at 11 , and then the middle of the day is usually full of a bunch of meetings or lunches or working on a " Today Show"piece .
Then we have another shoot at 4:30 - so again well pick the rundown for that show later that day , Ill re - write the scripts , and then I go to that shoot .
Somewhere in there I change my outfit because they do nt want me in the same shirt so that it does nt appear to be the same show and cause people to swipe out on Snapchat .
My days usually end with some type of event , whether its an appearance for work , or I m moderating lots of panels lately , or a work dinner , a client dinner , and prepping for future stories , things like that .
But those days , lately , are few and far between - there s a lot of travel going on .
So if its to go do an interview or a story its waking up pretty early , doing my own hair & makeup on the road , and then interviewing someone .
I tend to take a very long time when I interview somebody because I just get so deep into it , and then were trying to quickly turnaround stories immediately so that we can figure out how were going to shape the show .
We write it , then shoot it in the field , and then I get back to New York as soon as possible to be with friends or boyfriend or whatever .
Q.Whats been your favorite story to work on with Stay Tuned ?
A. The royal wedding was amazing , and I just got so bought in on the whole thing .
Its like there s this castle , and its so huge and so ... castle - y , and just bigger than you can even imagine with all these guards and the red outfits and the furry hats .
And then , just knowing that this American woman who was an actress , who s been divorced , who s half - black , is going to be in there with the royal family - its just so cool .
With the structure of the current royal family , its not going to happen again for a long time , so that felt like one of those events that Ill talk about later in life .
Then on the other end of the spectrum I covered heavily the Parkland ( Florida ) shooting and then the March for Our Lives events .
I went to Parkland a couple of times and then went to March for Our Lives with some of the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas ( High School ) .
What was so amazing about that - everyone can see what these kids have done and the difference that they ve made that their parents have never been able to make , which I think is really powerful -- was really getting to know them and kind of embed with them and understand their families , the strength that they have and how they re sort of choosing to move it forward .
What that story did on a wider scale with our audience - we may have topped it now , I think we actually have because our ( viewership ) numbers are growing a lot right now - but the day after the shooting was one of the biggest days we ve ever had numbers - wise , and at the time it was the highest .
To see our audience of this particular age engage so strongly with that story and feel so passionate about people their own age that looked like them being able make a difference ... going to the March and having so many people come up to me and tell me that they watch Stay Tuned and tell me that they want to do what I do and tell me that they write for their school newspaper .
It felt like this changing tide that obviously the whole nation can see as far as : is this going to change the next election ?
A record number of young people registered to vote .
Just being able to understand these kids and connect with them in that way and feeling like " wow , this is an event that totally galvanized this age group , " was pretty cool .
Q. What s the biggest lesson you ve learned in your career ?
Sellers : I m still learning all the time , but being the age that I am around people who for the most part are a lot older who specifically do what I do , has taught me a couple things .
First , always try to know what you do nt know .
Own if you need to learn something .
Its okay to ask for help , its okay to not graduate and be the smartest person on the planet .
There s going to be times when you re passed over for things , or you think that you would have been right for that .
Before this ( Stay Tuned ) , I did nt know what I was going to do .
When I was Phils assistant I had a period of time where I was like , how am I going to turn this in to what I want ?
Is this going to work ?
Should I have stayed here for this long ?
Everybody has the same questions that you have , the same concerns that you have .
Do nt let it eat you up and know that everybodys just trying to figure it out .
So , kind of just taking a breath and responding to things as calmly as you can in a professional space and just knowing that you re going to get a chance .
On the other end of the spectrum , just because of my age or because I m a woman , knowing when its OK to stand up for yourself and say , I do nt think that s fair .
And that comes with the money that you re making , with the contracts , or , in my line of work , for wanting to cover a story .
Q. What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your steps career - wise ?
Sellers : My path has been unconventional .
I could not have dreamed for a more perfect position than I m in now for myself , and I never would ve known that before .
So , just doing your own thing .
Do nt try to mimic somebody elses career path .
You can look at me and think my job is cool or want to be in the news too when you re a younger person .
That s amazing , and I love that , I love talking about that .
I always try to answer peoples questions and give them advice , but you re never going to be able to copy what somebody else did .
So , do nt be obsessed with that .
Let yourself relax and take the path that s going to work out for you .
You should also always be doing more than what your job description says .
That s the biggest thing that has worked out for me .
I ve basically had a day job and a side hustle within NBC always .
You do nt have to love whatever your job is on paper .
You can create and find opportunities if you re working within a company that you can see that you want to stay at , if you can see somebody else there having the job that you want to do .
You can always be learning from those people , you can be getting coffees with them , you can be asking to shadow them .
You can work on the weekends .
Its hard , and you will be tired , but it pays off .
Be prepared to work harder than you ever thought , but also just always be doing something different than your job description says , if you want something different than what you currently have .
And , always remember when you wanted what you have right now .
Try to appreciate when you do get what you want , and remember that , " I wanted this right now . "
Now you have it , and you still might be stressed out , but there was a time when exactly what you have right now you thought would be everything you ever wanted .

Taylor Palmby Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt , a Wisconsin native who played college football at Wisconsin , donated $ 10,000 to a GoFundMe page created for Cory Barr , the fire captain who was killed in an explosion Tuesday evening in downtown Sun Prairie , Wis. The explosion , which injured 15 and killed Barr , occurred on the corner of Main and Bristol streets after a gas main was struck by a contractor , which caused a leak .
Sun Prairie is located near Madison , which is where the University of Wisconsin is located , and about 60 miles from Watt 's hometown of Pewaukee .
Barr had been a member of the Sun Prairie Fire Department for 15 years .
He was also a realtor and owner of The Barr House tavern , which was one of the buildings destroyed in the explosion .
He is survived by his wife , Abby Barr , and twin daughters , who , according to Abby Barr , would shout " Daddy 's home ! "
whenever he walked through the door .
Watt 's donation is just one of over a thousand that have been made to support Barr 's family during this tragedy .
Watt , the child of a firefighter , silently made his donation hours after a woman tweeted him asking for his support .
Watt has not yet made any public comments about the donation , but he is a known philanthropist -- he helped raise over $ 37 million for those affected by Hurricane Harvey and he donated $ 10,000 to a Texas student who was injured during a football game .
Barr 's GoFundMe page has raised over $ 70,000 .
In addition , GoFundMe has created a centralized page for all GoFundMe campaigns involving the Sun Prairie explosion .

Teacher pay is disrupting class .
Here 's why .
We take a look at a typical West Virginia teacher 's household budget .
Its no wonder why they protested .
Here are the numbers , broken down .
Technically speaking , the backdrop for U.S. stocks has strengthened amid a grinding - higher July rally .
Consider that the Nasdaq Composite has reached record territory -- and is digesting a slight breakout -- while the S&P 500 concurrently challenges major resistance matching a five - month range top ( 2,802 ) .
The charts below add color : Before detailing the U.S. markets wider view , the S&P 500s US : SPX hourly chart highlights the past two weeks .
As illustrated , the S&Ps slow - motion breakout attempt remains underway .
Major overhead matches a five - month range top ( 2,802 ) and the recent selling pressure in this area has registered as flat .
Last weeks close ( 2,801 ) matched resistance , and the S&P has ventured fractionally higher early Tuesday .
Meanwhile , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has narrowly extended its July rally .
In the process , the blue - chip benchmark has ventured atop the 25,000 mark , notching consecutive closes nominally higher .
The prevailing upturn punctuates a successful test of the 50-day moving average .
Against this backdrop , the Nasdaq Composite is digesting a modest break to record territory .
Tactically , first support matches the June peak ( 7,806 ) -- better illustrated below -- and is followed by the near - term breakout point ( 7,777 ) .
Widening the view to six months adds perspective .
On this wider view , the Nasdaq has sustained a modest mid - July breakout .
Mondays close ( 7,805.7 ) matched first support at the June peak ( 7,806.6 ) .
Though near - term extended -- and a consolidation phase seems to be underway -- a near- to intermediate - term target projects from the June low to the 8,170 area .
Looking elsewhere , the Dow industrials backdrop remains comparably jagged .
Nonetheless , the blue - chip benchmark has edged atop the 25,000 mark , also placing distance atop the 50- and 200-day moving averages .
To reiterate , more distant inflection points match the June closing peak ( 25,322 ) and the absolute June peak ( 25,402 ) .
Meanwhile , the S&P 500 has effectively nailed major overhead .
The recent muted selling pressure near resistance ( 2,802 ) improves the chances of eventual follow - through .
The bigger picture Broadly speaking , an already - bullish technical backdrop has strengthened to start the third quarter .
On a headline basis , the Nasdaq Composite is digesting a break to record territory , the S&P 500 has nailed major resistance , and the still lagging behind Dow industrials have nonetheless cleared several key technical levels .
Moving to the small - caps , the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is consolidating just under all - time highs .
The July peak registered fractionally below record territory and the prevailing pullback remains shallow .
To reiterate , its record close ( 169.97 ) and absolute record peak ( 170.20 ) remain within striking distance .
Meanwhile , the S&P MidCap 400s July peak marked a fractional record .
Here again , the current pullback from the range top has been flat , fueled by decreased volume .
Constructive price action .
Looking elsewhere , the SPDR Trust S&P 500 is challenging the June peak ( 279.48 ) .
The SPY has notched three straight closes within a fraction of resistance , and its persistence near the range top is constructive .
Similarly , the S&P 500s backdrop is increasingly straightforward .
To reiterate , the S&P is challenging familiar overhead matching the March peak ( 2,802 ) .
Recent selling pressure near resistance has been muted , improving the chances of eventual follow - through .
Separately , recall major resistance is frequently cleared on the third or fourth independent retest .
The prevailing breakout attempt marks the third approach .
On further strength , additional overhead matches the January gap , an area broadly spanning from 2,838 to 2,851 .
This is followed by the S&P 500s absolute record high ( 2,872.9 ) , established Jan. 26 , a level also precisely matching its record close .
Slightly more broadly , an intermediate - term target projects from the June low to the 2,890 area .
Beyond specific levels , the prevailing backdrop remains uneven -- not one - size - fits - all -- though on balance the market technicals support a comfortably bullish intermediate- to longer - term bias .

Drilling down further , the United States Oil Fund US : USO has extended its July downturn .
The fund tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) light , sweet crude oil .
The shares initially turned lower last week , pressured amid concerns over increased Libyan production after the country lifted restrictions on its oil ports .
The downturn has accelerated this week , fueled by reports that Saudi Arabia may increase production , and that the U.S. may consider tapping its strategic petroleum reserve .
Technically , the shares have violated trendline support and the 50-day moving average , placing the intermediate - term trend in doubt .
A swift reversal atop the 14.30-to-14.40 area would place the brakes on bearish momentum .
Delving deeper , a near - term floor ( 13.60 ) is followed by important support matching the June low ( 13.00 ) .
The USOs longer - term bias remains bullish barring a violation .
Moving to U.S. sectors , the SPDR S&P Retail ETF US : XRT is acting well technically .
As illustrated , the group is digesting the steep early - June rally , maintaining support at the breakout point .
More broadly , the group is well positioned on the 10-year chart , poised to challenge record territory matching the 2015 peak ( 51.25 ) .
An eventual close higher opens the path to uncharted territory and potentially material follow - through .
Tactically , the ascending 50-day moving average has marked an inflection point , currently 48.20 , and a posture higher supports a bullish bias .
Five Below , Inc. US : FIVE is a well positioned large - cap specialty retailer .
The shares initially spiked five weeks ago , gapping to record territory after the companys strong first - quarter results .
The subsequent pullback has been flat -- underpinned by the top of the gap -- positioning the shares to build on the June spike .
More immediately , Mondays close marked a fractional record , opening the path to a potentially more decisive breakout .
A near - term target projects to the 106 area on follow - through .
NetEase , Inc. US : NTES is a large - cap Beijing - based Internet name showing signs of life .
Technically , the shares have established a tight one - week range , challenging resistance closely matching the 100-day moving average .
Underlying the upturn , its relative strength index ( not illustrated ) has recently notched a year - to - date peak , improving the chances of eventual follow - through .
Tactically , a near - term floor matches last week 's low ( 259.00 ) and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation .
Initially profiled April 19 , Applied Optoelectronics , Inc. US : AAOI has returned 53.8 % and remains well positioned .
The shares concluded May with a strong - volume breakout , knifing atop the 200-day moving average after a positive analyst research note .
More immediately , the tight July range signals muted selling pressure near resistance , positioning the shares to build on the steep May rally .
A breakout attempt is in play barring a violation of near - term support , circa 47.00 .
Still well positioned The table below includes names recently profiled in The Technical Indicator that remain well positioned .

Tesla cut brake and roll test from Model 3 production CNBC 's Phil LeBeau reports Tesla eliminated the standard " brake and roll " test in the final days of production on the Model 3 as the company worked to meet its production target of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week .
Tesla Inc. TSLA , -4.35 % shares fell nearly 4 % on Monday , putting them on track for their lowest close since June 5 .
The stock was the worst performer on the Nasdaq 100 NDX , -1.60 % , and it is down three out of past four days .
Chief Executive Elon Musk got into a fresh controversy on Twitter over the weekend , calling one of the cave explorers involved in the Thai soccer team rescue , a man who had criticized him , a pedophile .
That tweet has been deleted .
Tesla produced 7,000 cars , including 5,000 Model 3 electric sedans , in the last week of its second quarter , CEO Elon Musk said on Sunday .
Beating a self - imposed deadline , the final car rolling off the assembly line on Sunday morning , several hours after the midnight goal set by Musk , two workers at the factory told Reuters on Sunday .
Via Twitter , Musk said the company actually produced 7,000 cars last week in total .
Musk tweet The 5,000th Model 3 finished final quality checks at the Fremont , California factory and was ready to go around 5 a.m. PDT ( 1200 GMT ) , one person told Reuters .
It was not clear if Tesla could maintain that level of production for a longer period of time .
Tesla had a goal of producing 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery - powered sedan .
Money - losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3 , and delays have also potentially compromised Tesla 's first - to - market position for a mid - priced , long - range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles .
Production of the Model 3 has been plagued by a number of issues , including problems with an over - reliance on automation on its assembly lines , battery issues and other bottlenecks .
As the end of the quarter neared , Musk spurred on workers , built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory , and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target , including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter .
Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week , and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end - of - quarter production speed .
The company regularly engages in so - called " burst builds , " temporary periods of fast - as - possible production , which it uses to estimate how many cars it is capable of building over longer periods of time .
Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays warned investors in March to be wary of brief " burst rates " of Model 3 production that were not sustainable .
Tesla said in May that its net Model 3 reservations - accounting for new orders and cancellations - exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter .
Despite touting the Model 3 as a $ 35,000 vehicle , Tesla has yet to begin building that basic version and instead is currently building a higher - priced version .
It is not clear how many of the orders are for the higher - priced versions .
Tesla in January pushed back its target date for building 5,000 vehicles per week to the end of the second quarter , the latest in several delays that have concerned some investors .
Steady progress has enthused others , however , and Tesla 's market value is close to that of General Motors .
The company has said it will not need to raise cash this year .
Musk said the company hit its target of 5,000 Model 3s in a week , according to an email sent to employees on Sunday afternoon and seen by Reuters .
Tesla also expects to produce 6,000 Model 3 sedans a week " next month . "
Elon Musk , co - founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. Alberto E. Rodriguez | Getty Images " I think we just became a real car company , " Musk wrote .
The company hit the Model 3 mark while also achieving its production goal of 7,000 Model S and Model X vehicles in a week , Musk said in the email .
Tesla confirmed the contents of the email .
After repeatedly pushing back internal targets , Tesla vowed in January to build 5,000 Model 3s per week before the close of the second quarter on Saturday to demonstrate it could mass produce the battery - powered sedan .
Money - losing Tesla has been burning through cash to produce the Model 3 , and delays have also potentially compromised Teslas first - to - market position for a mid - priced , long - range battery electric car as a host of competitors prepare to launch rival vehicles .
Production of the Model 3 , which began last July , has been plagued by a number of issues , including problems from an over - reliance on automation on its assembly lines , battery issues and other bottlenecks .
As the end of the quarter neared , Musk spurred on workers , built a new assembly line in a huge tent outside the main factory , and fanned expectations that Tesla could hit its target , including tweeting pictures of rows of auto parts and robots over the final days of the quarter . "
It was pretty hectic , " said one worker who described the atmosphere as " all hands on deck . "
Another worker speaking after the 5,000th car was made described the factory as a " mass celebration . "
Tesla is likely to announce production and delivery numbers for the quarter later this week , and investors will watch to see whether the company can keep up its end - of - quarter production speed and increase efficiency to produce the cars at a profit .
Tesla seems to be able to weather negative headline after negative headline without any substantial decline because there are no " real sellers , " CNBC 's Jim Cramer said Thursday .
While the stock was under pressure Thursday after Tuesday 's 7 percent decline , Tesla has gained more than 200 percent in the past five years .
The longs , or those investors betting on a stock price increase , are " unshakable , " generally supporting the stock no matter what , Cramer said on " Squawk on the Street . " "
The sellers have n't developed in Tesla . " "
It 's stuck here because there are too many shorts , " or those investors betting against the stock , said Cramer , who said last month that he does n't make recommendations either way on Tesla because he " ca n't figure out the valuation . " "
You need real sellers " for the shorts to get any substantive downside movement in their favor , he said Thursday , stressing that there 's no chance of that happening until the stock loses its " cult status . "
Tesla is one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street .
Even with Thursday 's drop , Tesla shares have only lost about 8 percent over the past 12 months in the face of repeated production problems surrounding the electric car maker 's new less - expensive Model 3 sedan .
On Thursday , Cramer highlighted the work of Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi , an outspoken bear on Tesla stock . "
People ignore him at their own risk , " Cramer said of Sacconaghi , who was cut off by Tesla CEO Elon Musk during May 's post - earnings call .
Musk called Sacconaghi 's question about gross margins " boring " and " boneheaded . "
Cramer , the host of " Mad Money , " said the Bernstein analyst is asking the right , tough questions of Tesla .
Musk on Thursday sounded off on Twitter at media organizations Reuters , Business Insider and CNBC .
Musk accused both Reuters and Business Insider of publishing false or misleading stories .
He also suggested CNBC features analysts with poor prediction records .

Texas Instruments Inc. TXN , -0.32 % shares declined in the extended session Tuesday after the chip maker announced that President and Chief Executive Brian Crutcher is out because of code of conduct violations .
Texas Instruments shares fell 2.2 % after hours , following a 1.1 % gain to close the regular session at $ 115.80 .
Crutcher , who officially took over as CEO on June 1 , is also stepping down from the company board .
Chairman Rich Templeton will take on the added roles of president and CEO " on an ongoing , indefinite basis , " and the company said it will not be searching for a replacement .
In a statement , the company said Crutcher 's " violations are related to personal behavior that is not consistent with our ethics and core values , but not related to company strategy , operations or financial reporting . "
Texas Instruments is the third chip maker in less than a month where the CEO has stepped down over code of conduct violations following Brian Krzanich 's departure from Intel Corp. INTC , -1.22 % and Ron Black 's departure from Rambus Inc. RMBS , +1.26 % in June .
Additionally , Texas Instruments said it plans to report on July 24 second - quarter earnings of $ 1.40 a share , with a 3-cents - a - share tax benefit that was n't included in the company 's original guidance , on revenue of $ 4.02 billion .
Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimate earnings of $ 1.30 a share on revenue of $ 3.96 billion .

Girls Track & Field Coach of the Year : Julie Alano , Hamilton Southeastern EVENTS : Sprints | Distance | Hurdles | Jumps & Heptathlon | Throws MORE : Second Team ATHLETE PROFILE : Katelyn Tuohy School : North Rockland ( Tiells , N.Y. ) Year : Sophomore Event : 1500 , mile , 3000 , 3200 It took until the final day of national high school competition this season for a classic record -- a year older than USA Today - to be finally eclipsed .
And it was by a sophomore .
Katelyn Tuohy of North Rockland ( Tiells , N.Y. ) is the American Family Insurance ALL - USA girls high school track and field athlete of the year after erasing the oldest girls record .
She ran the mile in 4 minutes , 33.87 seconds at the New Balance Nationals in Greensboro , N.C. , on June 17 to better the 36-year - old mark of 4:35.24 set by Polly Plumer of University ( Irvine , Calif. ) on May 16 , I982 .
That completed a sweep of ancient girls distance records ( mile and 3,200 meters ) and a brilliant year of running by Tuohy , who was a second team All - USA selection as a freshman in 2017 .
In the fall , she won a cross country title at the Nike Cross Nationals , setting a course record .
During the indoor season , she ran 3,000 meters in 9:05.26 , second on the all - time high school indoor list to the record 9:04.51 by Mary Cain of Bronxville ( N.Y. ) in 2013 .
Tuohy finished the indoor campaign with a two mile victory at the New Balance Nationals , setting a world age 15 record of 9:58.89 ( the first underclass runner to better ten minutes ) .
Moving outdoors , Tuohy set the high school record for 3,200 meters at the Glenn Loucks Games in White Plains , N.Y. on May 12 , running 9:47.88 to eclipse the 22-year - old mark of 9:48.59 by Kim Mortensen ( Thousand Oaks , Calif. ) .
At the New York state meet she won the 3,000 meters in a state record 9:09.71 , No .
3 on the all - time high school outdoor list , and the 1,500 meters in 4:14.45 ( No .
8 all - time ) on consecutive days this month .
Tuohy then put the exclamation point on her year with the dramatic mile achievement in the heat in Greensboro , running virtually alone after a 67-second first 440 yard lap .
She continued to pull away to win by a 16-second margin with a 68-second final lap . "
It is actually pretty scary to be responsible for a talent like this , " said her coach Brian Diglio in a New York Times story this month .
Her parents , Patrick and Denise , have limited Tuohys media exposure and interviews .
The statistics on her accomplishments have , however , spoken loudly .
PRESEASON : 2018 ALL - USA Preseason Girls Track and Field Team LOOKBACK : 2016 - 17 ALL - USA Girls Track and Field Team
The 2018 Emmy Awards nominations will be announced Thursday , and the contenders are likely to be a mostly familiar group of actors and TV shows .
You 're bound to see a host of nominations for the likes of " Westworld " ( pun intended ) , " Game of Thrones , " " Black - ish , " " Curb Your Enthusiasm " and other stalwarts that have been turning in good work , year in and year out .
And while it 's great to recognize consistent quality , it can also make the Emmys a little too predictable and boring .
Fortunately for the Television Academy , the 2017 - 18 TV season had plenty of new and underrated talent that 's just as Emmy - worthy as many of the usual favorites .
We rounded up five potential nominations on the edge of a nod , and if they manage to eke out spots on the ballot , they could help make the Emmys a more exciting and competitive awards show .
Here 's hoping . '
Killing Eve , ' for outstanding drama series Last year 's champ " The Handmaid 's Tale " is likely to return in this category and face off against 2016 winner " Game of Thrones " ( which was ineligible in 2017 ) .
Other worthy contenders include the exquisite final season of " The Americans " and previous nominees " This Is Us , " " Stranger Things , " " The Crown " and " Westworld . "
It 's a pretty packed category , but how delightful would it be if BBC America 's breakout hit " Killing Eve " could worm its way onto the list ?
The weird and wonderful drama , about an MI6 agent ( Sandra Oh ) who gets a little too involved with the serial assassin ( Jodie Comer ) she 's tracking , is one of this year 's most pleasant TV surprises .
Smart , darkly funny and just a little bit sexy , it would be a welcome addition to a category routinely dominated by the most depressing series around .
Vanessa Kirby of ' The Crown , ' for best supporting actress in a drama The queen gets all the glory , but do n't ignore the princess .
In the second season of Netflix 's " The Crown , " based on the life of Elizabeth II , Claire Foy continued to do great work as the monarch ( and was nominated for Season 1 ) .
However , the new season was also a showcase for Elizabeth 's little sister , Princess Margaret , played with vivacity by Kirby .
She relishes every drag of Margaret 's ever - present cigarettes , deftly channelingthe struggling princess ' complex emotions as she hastily marries in a lousy match ( Matthew Goode ) out of fear that her royal status will keep her from finding truelove .
Margaret does n't wear the crown , but she was the absolute gem of Season 2 . '
One Day at a Time , ' for best comedy series No other series , comedy or drama , can elicit the same level of joy as " One Day at a Time . "
Netflix 's revival of the Norman Lear classic stars Justina Machado and Rita Moreno , and it 's a warm bath of sunlight , a refreshingly earnest sitcom that wades into hot - button social issues with ease , and without becoming preachy .
Its first season premiered in 2017 to critical acclaim but no major Emmy love .
This year Moreno might nab a best- supporting actress nomination , thanks to the season 's devastating finale , in which her character , Lydia , nearly dies .
But the whole series deserves recognition for its stellar performances and the way it makes the studio - audience sitcom formula feel fresh again .
Issa Rae of ' Insecure , ' for best comedy actress The second season of HBO 's comedy managed to be even deeper and stronger than its first , and the same goes for Rae 's performance as Issa Dee .
Finally free of a long - term relationship that was going nowhere , Issa starts to figure out her life , while making messy mistakes along the way . "
Insecure " might also compete for best comedy or for supporting actress Yvonne Orji , but Rae is its best shot at a nomination .
The comedy has become a sensation among dedicated fans , and the Emmys would do well to acknowledge its buzz . '
Alias Grace , ' for best limited series The newer limited - series category has quickly become one of the most competitive , and this year heavy hitters including " The Assassination of Gianni Versace : American Crime Story , " " The Looming Tower " and " Godless " are expected to nab nominations .
All were great , but the Emmys might sleep on the best miniseries of the year if " Alias Grace , " Netflix 's adaptation of Margaret Atwood 's 1996 novel , is left out .
The breathtaking adaptation outshines that of " Handmaid 's , " also from an Atwood novel .
A murder story wrapped in mysticism , gender roles and history , " Grace " is one of the most uniquely rewarding TV experiences in years , with an exceptional performance by lead Sarah Gadon , gorgeous direction by Mary Harron and unnervingly good scripts by Atwood and Sarah Polley .
It has flown under the radar compared with its heavily promoted competition , but it deserves to break into the race .

The Amazon Echo , left , and Google Home Source : ( L to R ) Amazon ; Google When it comes to voice assistants , Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant lead the pack by far .
With reports that Alexa may be losing dominance , the competition between the two is only going to get more intense .
CNBC spoke to five ad agencies and who have worked on projects on both devices on behalf of marketers , usually creating branded apps for the voice experience .
Here 's the pros and cons they 've seen for each device .
The case for Alexa Alexa everywhere .
Alexa has entered far more homes and offices .
About two - thirds of U.S. smart speaker enthusiasts will use an Amazon Echo according to eMarketer , with Google Home coming in at just 30 percent .
But Amazon wants Alexa to be in as many devices as possible rather than just its own products , according to Chris Neff , senior director of innovation at advertising agency The Community .
Even if Alexa - enabled devices created by Amazon are losing market share , it could continue to gain ground through Alexa partners , he pointed out . "
The biggest strength of Alexa , of Amazon , is right now the market penetration and their goal of getting Alexa into everything and everywhere , " Neff said .
A seamless retail experience .
Alexa is tightly integrated into Amazon 's core shopping platform . "
The most expensive ad space in the future will be Alexa , " digital agency Huge global executive creative director for innovation Sophie Kleber said . "
They are really just integrated in the shopping platform . "
This has also opened up the door for marketers to sell items through Alexa apps .
VaynerMedia worked on converting popular mobile game " Heads Up ! "
for Alexa , and was the first to integrate a voice - activated one time payment functionality to buy add - ons . "
That s a whole different way to monetize work , " said Patrick Givens , vice president and head of IoT and emerging tech division VaynerSmart .
A developer ecosystem .
A couple agencies also pointed out Amazon has been very open to experimentation , and has invested quite a bit in tools for developers like Amazon Voice Services .
In addition to testing out payments , apps like Gimlet Medias Chompers - a two - minute podcast to get kids to brush their teeth - has a natural home on Alexa for Kids .
An interactive audio story made by Earplay and Universal for " Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom " lets players dodge dinosaurs using the Amazon Echo 's buttons . "
More developers are coming into the Alexa ecosystem , because they ve made it easier for developers to create skills and apps , " said Dan Calladine , media and marketing agency Dentsu Aegis head of media futures . "
What we are starting to see is more creativity in the space . "
The case for Google Assistant Better language processing .
For Alexa and Assistant to become real voice assistants , Neff said they 'll need to be able to nuances of how people speak , where they are located , and what they would like based on their past history .
For example , it should be able to understand Neff is living in Miami , and based on what he frequents , know not only that he likes Hispanic food but exactly what type of cuisine . "
Now that I 'm able to ask these smart devices recommendations , I would want to ask them to tell me something interesting to me , " Neff elaborated . "
We 're delving more into it being an assistant and less of it being a transactional device . "
While Alexa has an advantage in e - commerce , agencies say Google Assistant is better at natural language processing thanks to Googles history of being a search engine .
It has a leg up at understanding how people speak and finding them the right answer .
The Associated Press A former cast member of the television reality series " Bad Girls Club " was arrested on charges alleging she stole debit card information from a man who died shortly after a date with her .
Shannade Clermont was arrested Wednesday on charges including wire fraud and aggravated identity theft , the Associated Press reported .
Prosecutors said the man she visited in January 2017 was found dead of a drug overdose the next morning in his midtown Manhattan apartment .
Her lawyer did not immediately return a message seeking comment .
The criminal complaint said Clermont appeared on the Oxygen network 's reality series " Bad Girls Club " in 2015 along with her twin sister and amassed a large social media following .
Her Twitter account listed over 100,000 followers .
Authorities said the 24-year - old Clermont used stolen debit card information to try to obtain over $ 20,000 .
They say she used the money to pay her rent and phone bills , buy plane tickets and make online purchases of clothing and other merchandise .
Prosecutors said that text messages between the victim 's phone and Clermont 's phone before the date show that they agreed the encounter would cost $ 400 .
They also revealed that she created an " Exotic Doll " email account on July 9 , 2013 , that they say Clermont " used to solicit dates for prostitution and other sexual encounters through various websites . "
The Associated Press CANBERRA , Australia ( AP ) -- Oscar - winning actor Geoffrey Rush has pulled out of Shakespeare stage production in Australia as he sues a Sydney newspaper for defamation .
Melbourne Theatre Company Artistic Director Brett Sheehy said he received confirmation Monday of Rush 's withdrawal from the role of Malvolio in a seven - week season of " Twelfth Night " that begins on Nov. 12 .
Rush cited his current circumstances and medical advice for having to withdraw . "
I do so with the greatest regret .
I know that I would not be able to provide the necessary creative spirit and the professional stamina required , " Rush said in the statement received by the artistic director .
Sheehy said the company respected Rush 's decision and the resulting casting decisions would be made " in due course . "
The Australian actor is suing The Daily Telegraph for defamation over articles published in December that accused him of inappropriate behavior toward actress Eryn Jean Norvill during the Sydney Theatre Company 's production of " King Lear " in 2015 .
Rush has denied the allegation .
He argues that the articles portray him as a pervert and sexual predator .
Details of the alleged behavior remain vague .
More : Geoffrey Rush sues Sydney newspaper over sexual - predator allegations Related : Rush is housebound and barely eating following misconduct claims , lawyer says His lawyer Nicholas Pullen told the Australian Federal Court in Sydney in April in an affidavit that Rush had become virtually housebound , barely eats and wakes each morning with a " terrible sense of dread " since the articles were published .
Rush " suffers lack of sleep and anxiety requiring medication " and believes his worth to the entertainment industry " is now irreparably damaged , " his lawyer wrote .
Rush met with the newspaper 's lawyers in a confidential mediation hearing in Sydney last week that suggests the case might soon be settled .
Rush was to appear in " Twelfth Night " with actress Christie Whelan Browne playing Olivia .
Whelan Browne is being sued in the New South Wales state Supreme Court by actor and musician Craig McLachlan for defamation .
McLachlan , who is a household name in Australia , left a stage show and a TV series he was to star in was canceled after Whelan Browne and two other actresses -- Angela Scundi and Erika Heynatz -- accused him of indecent assault , sexual harassment and bullying during a 2014 production of " The Rocky Horror Show " in Melbourne .
McLachlan denies the allegations .
Rush won the 1997 best actor Academy Award for " Shine " and has three other Oscar nominations .
He is perhaps best known as Captain Barbossa in the " Pirates of the Caribbean " films .
The Associated Press NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Whitney Houston 's mother says allegations that her superstar daughter and her son were molested by her niece are " unfathomable . "
In a statement to People magazine on behalf of herself and sister , singer Dionne Warwick , Cissy Houston revealed they first learned of the claims two days before the documentary " Whitney " premiered in May. In the film , Whitney Houston 's longtime assistant said the singer told her that cousin Dee Dee Warwick molested her as a child and Whitney 's oldest brother also claimed he , too , was molested .
In the statement , Cissy Houston says Dee Dee Warwick may have had her " personal challenges , " but the idea that she would have molested her children is " overwhelming and unfathomable . "
Dee Dee Warwick died in 2008 .
Whitney Houston died in 2012 .
The magazine hits newsstands on Friday .

The average price of a house bought in San Francisco rose by $ 205,000 in the first half of 2018 , the largest six - month increase in history , according to MLS data compiled by local real estate agency Paragon .
The average house in the city limits now costs $ 1.62 million .
Condo prices also rose by $ 71,000 , which is a significantly slower pace of change than in past years , but still comes in at a startling $ 1.21 million .
This is a direct outgrowth of the current tech boom in Silicon Valley , which shows no signs of slowing down .
The best that investors can hope for from General Electric Co. when the struggling industrial conglomerate reports second - quarter results before the stock market opens on Friday is boring -- just plain earnings and revenue , with a little free cash flow and no drama about new charges or comments about the dividend .
Investors have had a lot to stress over the past year , as the stock has tumbled nearly 50 % .
The company has undergone a leadership change , cut its dividend in half , uncovered large insurance - related losses and continued to transform its focus through planned asset sales .
Chief Executive John Flannery gave a confidence - rattling presentation at an industry conference in May. And earlier this month , GEs stock GE , -2.09 % was booted from the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % after a record 111-year run .

Despite investor hopes that things ca nt get much worse , the stock has floundered the past several months , hitting a nine - year low as recently as June 25 , as both Wall Street and credit analysts remain skeptical about the timing of any real turnaround .
Although the stock rallied briefly in late June , after GE announced plans to spin off its health - care business and sell off its ownership in Baker Hughes US : BHGE , S&P Global Ratings cut its outlook on GEs credit to negative , saying the moves would reduce diversity and potentially increase volatility in profitability and cash flow .
Read more about S&Ps outlook cut .
And long - time bearish analyst Stephen Tusa at J.P. Morgan reiterated last week his underweight rating and Street - low price target of $ 11 , which implies a 20 % tumble from current levels , as he continued to question GEs liquidity and what other cash flow problems may come to light .
While analysts may want more answers about what may be coming down the road , investors may be more interested in a clean and simple report about the companys financial performance over the three months ended June 30 , and little else .
Especially because , if investors would have paid more attention to GEs past earnings reports , which many viewed as confusing and potentially misleading , they may have seen the troubles coming .
Heres what investors will be looking for in Fridays report : What to expect Earnings : The average analyst estimate compiled by FactSet is for adjusted earnings per share , excluding nonrecurring items , of 18 cents , down from 28 cents in the same period a year earlier .
Estimize , a crowd - sourcing platform that gathers estimates from buy - side analysts , hedge - fund managers , company executives , academics and others , as well as from Wall Street analysts , has a consensus EPS of 20 cents .
GE beat earnings expectations in the first quarter , to break a streak of three - straight misses .
FactSet In the first - quarter report , GE tried to eliminate confusion by changing what it called non - GAAP ( Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ) EPS that was comparable to analyst estimates to a more - standard " adjusted EPS , " and put that in bullet points on the first page of the earnings release , from " industrial operating + verticals EPS ( excluding 4Q charges not included in November 13 , 2017 guidance ) , " which was nt reported until page 10 .
Revenue : The FactSet revenue consensus is for $ 29.40 billion , down from $ 29.56 billion last year .
Estimize is projecting , on average , revenue of $ 29.96 billion .
GE beat revenue expectations for the first quarter , after two - straight misses .
Stock price : GEs stock edged up 0.2 % in afternoon trade Thursday .
It has gained 2.2 % since the end of the first quarter , but was still down 21 % year to date .
In comparison , the SPDR Industrial Select Sector exchange - traded fund XLI , -1.39 % has slipped 1.5 % this year while the Dow industrials has edged up 1.5 % .
The average rating of 19 analysts surveyed by FactSet is the equivalent of hold , while the average price target is $ 16.03 , or about 16 % above current levels .
That average price target has declined from $ 17.50 as of the end of the first quarter , and from $ 21 at the end of 2017 .
The stock had gained 3.9 % on the day first - quarter results were reported , but had declined on the day of nine of the 10 previous reports , by an average of 1.9 % .
The stock gained 1.1 % on the day third - quarter 2017 results were reported .
Options traders are currently pricing in a move of about 4.3 % in either direction on Friday , based on the pricing of an options strategy known as a " straddle . "
Other issues The three remaining business segments that GE plans to focus on going forward are Power , Aviation and Renewable Energy .
The following are the FactSet revenue estimates for those three segments : * Power : $ 7.10 billion , up from $ 6.97 billion a year ago . *
Aviation : $ 7.22 billion , up from $ 6.80 billion last year * Renewable Energy : $ 2.15 billion , down from $ 2.46 billion last year .
Free cash flow remains of interest to investors , given that the company said in November when it halved its dividend that it would focus on free cash flow ( FCF ) versus cash from operating activities ( CFOA ) .
Margins may also be of interest , since CEO Flannery highlighted the improvement in margins , as well as FCF , as signs of progress in its performance .
Last quarter , FCF improved to -$1.68 billion from -$2.75 billion a year ago , while margins improved to 7.7 % from 5.2 % .

Sisson did n't really mind .

But then the tables were turned .
She was told to write " ugly " ... in big green letters , on her friend .

Photo shoot pictures shared thousands of times on social media Indiana photographer Cindy Johnson 's made her point .
She had handed out markers to her all - shapes - and - sizes swimsuit models to illustrate how people are willing to accept harsh words about themselves , but go soft when asked to apply them -- literally , in this case -- to others .
Johnson 's rural property , off a state road in Franklin , not far from Heritage Baptist College , seems an unexpected locale for a body - positive swimsuit photo shoot to go viral .
But that 's what happened in late May. The 44-year - old photographer gave short notice to 40 friends and acquaintances , inviting them to an informal photo shoot in her backyard .
She put the impromptu shoot together , she said , because she was tired of the onslaught of ads offering to help her get a " beach body " or " bikini body . "

SCREW THAT . "
Johnson , a mom of four who had weight - loss surgery five years ago , did n't expect that the project would be shared thousands of times on Facebook and picked up by international media .
She simply decided that it 's not her job ( or yours ) to be a " decoration at the beach . "

Skinny b * * * * , " " I hate you , " " Eat something " -- White has heard them all .
Sure , there 's a bit of appreciation in such comments , she said , but they all come with " a self - judgment chaser . "

Having a body like mine -- slender , muscular -- I was never allowed by many around me to have body issues , " she said .
Indiana photographer 's journey born of her own struggles Johnson has made a decade - long career of turning her camera lens away from narrow ideals of youth and beauty and toward acceptance .
It 's a journey born out of her own life .
When she was 10 , she weighed about 150 pounds , and her well - meaning mother signed her up for Weight Watchers . "
I do n't blame her .
She was trying to make me feel better , " Johnson said . "
But it does n't work .
It just does n't . "
About 10 years ago , she picked up a Canon Rebel to photograph her kids .
Then , a friend asked her to take some boudoir photographs of her .
What started as , " Yeah , I 'll photograph you in your underwear " turned into a mission when the friend said , " I 've never felt so beautiful in my life . "
Now , Johnson does about seven boudoir shoots a week .

The Boeing Co. ba said Friday it will recognize a $ 124 million after - tax charge in the second quarter , after a court ruled against it in a case involving the 2005 sale of its production facilities in Wichita , Kansas .
The aerospace giant said the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that it is not entitled to recover certain costs associated with the sale of the facilities to Spirit Aerosystems .
Boeing filed a suit against Spirit in 2014 seeking to enforce its right to indemnification and recover sums incurred to cover pension and retiree medical obligations .
When it lost that case , it filed an appeal with the state 's supreme court .
The charge will not impact revenue or free cash flow .
Boeing shares were up 1.1 % on Friday , and have gained 18.6 % in 2018 , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average djia has gained 1.2 % and the S&P 500 spx has gained 4.8 % .
The Boeing Co. BA , -4.88 % said Tuesday it has received orders and commitments from Air Lease Corp. AL , -2.66 % for 78 jets in a deal valued at $ 9.6 billion .
The aerospace giant made the announcement at the Farnborough air show , saying the order includes 75 737 MAX 8s and three 787 - 9 Dreamliners .
ALC has now placed orders and commitments for 361 Boeing airplanes since 2010 .
Boeing shares were flat premarket , but have gained 20.8 % in 2018 , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % , which counts Boeing as a member , has gained 1.4 % , and the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has gained 4.7 % .
The bond market is asserting its independence .
Buffeted as it is by an array of external forces and internal dynamics , the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has refused to kowtow to a strong economy , rising inflation , widening budget deficits and prospective interest - rate increases , all of which , in and of themselves , would have been sufficient in previous eras to send yields soaring .
Not this time .
The 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.435 % breached the 3 % level definitively in May for the first time in more than four years , tried it out for a week or so before saying , thanks , but no thanks , and retreating to its comfort zone of 2.85 % or thereabouts .
So what gives ?
By definition , the long - term rate is equal to sum of the current and future expected short - term rates .
The Federal Reserve , which sets the current short - term rate and gives ample guidance about future expected short - term rates , seems to be talking to a deaf audience .
How can we explain the disconnect ?
Here is a summary of some of the explanations that have been offered .
1 .
The Fed is just plain wrong The Fed has been well ahead of interest - rate futures markets in projecting increases in the federal funds rate .
The fed funds futures market challenged the Feds optimistic projections for 2015 and 2016 , both of which produced a single , 25-basis - point rate increase in the final month of the year .
The market was right then .
Is it right now ?
The Feds most recent " dot plot , " which reflects policy makers expectations for gross domestic product , inflation , the unemployment rate , and the funds rate over the next few years and in the long run , suggests two more 25-basis - point rate increases this year , three more in 2019 , and one more in 2020 .
That puts policy makers median forecast for the funds rate at 3.1 % ( a range of 3%-3.25 % ) in 2019 and 3.4 % in 2020 , both of which are above what the Fed considers to be the longer - run neutral rate of 2.9 % .
The fed funds futures market is nt sold just yet on a December rate increase , putting the probability at 62 % .
And implied yields on contracts maturing in 2019 and 2020 , while not as actively traded , are nowhere near the Feds projected path .
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell told senators Tuesday that the economy is doing well and inflation is near target .
Alex Wong / Getty Images Whether the Fed sees it this way or not , the bond market holds all the cards .
Why ?
Because unless long - term yields rise and give the Fed some breathing room , the fed funds rate will close in on and eventually exceed the long - term Treasury yield , causing the term spread to invert and the best - laid plans of central bankers to go awry .

Increased demand for safe assets Ever since the 2008 financial crisis , there has been an increased demand for safe assets , defined as assets that carry no credit risk and pay off a fixed amount at a specified future date .
U.S. Treasuries fit that definition to a T. ( No , a failure by Congress to raise the debt ceiling in a timely manner does not mean the U.S. government will fail to make timely payments of interest and principal on sovereign debt . )
Conservatives may think the U.S. government spends too much and has too much debt outstanding , but investors see things differently .
What s more , in response to financial regulations instituted in 2014 , banks are now required to hold " enough high - quality liquid assets to cover expected net cash outflows during a 30-day stress period , " according to a primer on the new liquidity ratio requirements by Richmond Fed economists .
Once again , Treasury securities are among the most liquid assets that can be used to satisfy that coverage ratio .

The Feds large - scale asset purchases Through several rounds of quantitative easing between 2008 and 2014 , the Fed tripled its share of publicly held debt from 7 % to almost 22 % .
Some analysts point to the Feds LSAP , concentrated on longer - term securities , as exerting a distorting influence on the yield curve .
All it took was a hint of a reduced pace of Fed purchases in June 2013 by then - Fed Chairman Ben to send the markets reeling .
The so - called " taper tantrum " sent 10-year Treasury yields up 50 basis points in a matter of weeks and another 50 basis points by year end , when the actual tapering began .
Fast forward four years , and the Fed gave the market ample warning that it would begin to allow Treasury and mortgage - backed securities to mature at a gradual pace , starting in October 2017 with a combined $ 10 billion a month and increasing every quarter to $ 50 billion this month .
This time , there was no tantrum , no sell - off , no nothing .

Inflated inflation Last week , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index rose 2.9 % in June from a year earlier , the biggest increase in six years .
Yet there was barely a flutter in the bond market .
The core CPI , which excludes food and energy prices , rose 2.3 % in the last 12 months .
Even the Feds preferred inflation measure , the personal consumption expenditures price index , has perked up in recent months , rising 2.3 % in May from a year earlier .
The core PCE price index , which the Fed thinks is a better indicator of future inflation , hit 2 % in May for the first time in six years .
Why no reaction in the bond market ?
Base effect .
The year - over - year calculations were inflated because of the unusually low readings from a year earlier , a result of " idiosyncratic factors , " according to the Fed .
When the low monthly readings from 2017 are dropped out of the equation , the year - over - year increase should look less threatening .
Besides , the Fed has stressed that 2 % is a symmetric target for inflation .
After consistently undershooting the target for six years , the Fed is probably relieved to learn that it finally hit the bulls - eye .
5 .
The expansion is living on borrowed time The U.S. economy is in a sweet spot at the moment .
As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell outlined in his semi - annual testimony to Congress on Tuesday , job growth and business investment are strong , inflation has finally moved up to the Feds target , and federal tax and spending policy are goosing an economy perceived to be operating at full employment .
The expansion just entered its 10th year at a time when the Fed is removing its stimulus and the potential for a trade war is looming .
In other words , there is lots of room for a policy error .
And who , pray tell , generally sniffs out the danger ahead before policy makers get wind of it ?
Why , that would be Mr. Market .
The Boss is coming to Netflix .
A filmed version of " Springsteen on Broadway , " Bruce Springsteen 's acoustic one - man show , will hit Netflix on Dec. 15 , the online streaming service announced Wednesday . "
Springsteen on Broadway " clocks in at two hours and features 15 of his biggest musical hits along with lengthy life stories from his 2016 memoir , " Born to Run . "
He touches on his childhood , political awakening and the death of bandmate Clarence Clemons .
Later in the show , his wife of 27 years , Patti Scialfa , makes an appearance to sing " Tougher than the Rest " and " Brilliant Disguise . "
The show ends with - what else ? -
a contemplative version of " Born to Run . "
More:'Springsteen on Broadway ' : A revelatory night with a rock ' n ' roll legend Earlier this week , recording equipment was seen being loaded into the Walter Kerr Theatre , where Springsteen 's show is performed .
The December release coincides with the final night of Springsteen 's sold - out 236-show run , which earned him a special Tony Award this year , presented by Billy Joel . (
He 's now missing only an Emmy to reach the elite EGOT winners group . )
The bull market underway in equities is like a " fine wine " -- its great , but it is nt getting any better , according to Richard Weiss , chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at American Century Investments .
That s why right now he s not buying on the dips . "
Decelerating economic growth , equity valuations fair at best , rising interest rates , the specter of inflation -- this is not a recipe for a bull market , " he told CNBCs " Power Lunch " on Thursday .
In fact , his firm , which has $ 169 billion in assets under management , is neutral to underweight in stocks , particularly for those investors near or in retirement .
Within the equity portfolio , he said hell likely be rotating from growth stocks to consumer staples and other defensive sectors .
The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College just released a study that explores whether the source of variation in returns for state and local pension funds is due to asset allocation or returns by asset class .
The short answer is returns by asset class , primarily because public plans tend to have fairly similar asset allocations .
On average , the annualized return - net - of fees - for public plans was 5.5 % from 2001 - 2016 .
But returns varied from 6.3 % for plans in the top quartile to 4.6 % for plans in the bottom quartile ( see figure below ) .
The Class B shares of Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B , -0.61 % jumped 5.5 % in midday trade , putting them on track for the biggest gain since September 2011 , after policy change gave Chief Executive Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Mungermore flexibility in buying back Berkshire shares .
The stock was the biggest percentage gainer within the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF , -1.11 % , of which 67 of the 68 equities components were rising .
J.P. Morgan analyst Sarah DeWitt said the new repurchase policy is " a major positive catalyst " for the stock , since it gives Buffett and Munger more flexibility to spend excess cash of about $ 86 billion , which has been a large drag on returns , " particularly given Berkshire has not been able to find attractively valued acquisitions in an expensive market . "
Berkshire has n't bought back any shares since the previous policy was introduced in September 2011 .
The stock has rallied 18 % over the past year , while the financial ETF has gained 13 % and the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has advanced 14 % .
The Cleveland Indians bullpen has been nothing short of a disaster this season .
But it reached a new low Tuesday night when the wrong pitcher emerged from the bullpen - to the surprise of manager Terry Francona and players - with the game on the line in the ninth inning .
Thanks to a brilliant outing from starter Trevor Bauer , the Indians took a 4 - 0 lead over the Cincinnati Reds into the ninth .
But closer Cody Allen ran into some trouble , giving up a two - out RBI single , a two - run double and a pair of walks to load the bases .
With their lead cut to one and the Reds ' best hitter , lefty - swinging Joey Votto , due up , Francona trotted to the mound to bring in southpaw Oliver Perez .
Except Perez was n't the reliever warming up in the bullpen .
Right - hander Dan Otero was .
So why did the Indians have Otero in the game and not Perez ?
Francona said afterward he asked pitching coach Carl Willis to get " OP " warming up , but Willis mistakenly thought he heard " OT " - meaning Otero .
Predictably , Votto lined a 3 - 2 pitch to the gap in right - center field to clear the bases and put the Reds ahead in a game they would go on to win 7 - 4 .
Despite sitting in first place in the AL Central , the Indians have one of the worst bullpens in the majors this season .
Their relievers ' 5.13 ERA entering Tuesday 's play ranks 28th out of 30 teams .

The clinical trial for an Alzheimers treatment from drugmakers Biogen and Eisai was " extremely encouraging " -- but more still needs to be done , Biogen Chairman Stelios Papadopoulos told CNBC on Friday .
The companies announced positive results on Thursday from a Phase II study with BAN2401 , an anti - amyloid beta protofibril antibody , in 856 patients with early Alzheimer 's disease .
The trial demonstrated for the first time that there is an antibody that can clear plaque in the brain , Papadopoulos said on " Closing Bell . " "
More importantly , what this trial showed is that the clearance of plaque was associated with a slowdown of the cognitive decline , " he added , noting it is the first time a rigorous trial has shown that .
However , he pointed out , " Its not as if we improved the condition or we stabilized even the cognitive decline .
We ve slowed down the cognitive decline . " "
Its an extremely encouraging first step but its only a first step .
We need to do a lot more , " said Papadopoulos .
The clock kept running .
So did John Esposito .
Or " Spo , " as friends call him .
His last race for Somers High was 100 meters at the Westchester County Track & Field Championships .
He did nt run straight .
He did nt run fast .
But he ran -- as he always did -- straight into the crowds heart , earning warm cheers .
John Espositos high school sports calendar was full .
He managed the football team and boys basketball team , ran the 100 and threw the shot put for the spring track team .
He kept up his grades and is now deciding among three colleges to study business or finance .
He did this despite being blind .
John , 17 , who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 4 , started losing his vision in middle school to optic atrophy .
Its a congenital affliction shared by his eldest brother , Joe , 24 .
Middle brother , Michael , 21 , does not have it . "
There s no medication , " their dad , Joe , said . "
There s nothing they can do . "
He said doctors disagree about whether diabetes is a root cause .
Johns eyesight has deteriorated to the point he sees only shadows .
Originally , he began having problems with peripheral vision .
But he could still play sports .
Chief among them was his first love , basketball , which he played until eighth grade .
He was nt the best player but he was one of those 100-percent , 100-percent - of - the - time kids . "
He always made the most out of what he was able to do .
He always gave everything , " said Somers varsity boys basketball coach Chris DiCintio , who has known John since John was little .
John dove at the chance when DiCintio asked him manage his team .
Senior night , John was given a uniform and was part of the starting unit against Panas .
John had practiced layups from the same spot on the floor all week .
He missed the first couple he tried .
When the next went in , the gym exploded .
The crowd yelled , " Johnny Spo !
Johnny Spo ! "
DiCintio recalled .
Panas was cheering , too . "
It was really touching , " DiCintio said .
John made a big impression on the kids around him .
DiCintio said his own son ( also Chris ) , who ll attend John Jay College of Criminal Justice , made John the subject of his college entrance essay .
Because of his poor vision , John could nt do everything most team managers do .
But in some ways he did more .
In one basketball game , Somers trailed at the half .
John heard DiCintio and three assistants talking about making adjustments to ignite the misfiring offense .
John approached DiCintio , asking whether he d consider using two new plays DiCintio had his team recently practice .
DiCintio ran with that suggestion . "
It sparked the team , " DiCintio said .
Somers won and John was named its player of the game . "
He s a special kid , " DiCintio said , adding kids took " Johnny under their wing but not in a pity way , more as compassionate . " "
He came to be an inspiration to me and to everyone in the school , " football coach Tony DeMatteo said . "
His resiliency and demeanor just inspired everyone .
If I had a bad day , it made me change my tune . "
One of DeMatteos favorite memories is John standing at the 50-yard line with Tusker team captains for the coin toss before the 2016 State Championship in the Syracuse Carrier Dome .
Somers went on to defeat Greece Athena for the title .
Earlier that season , the Tuskers were coming off a stinging 21-point loss to Yorktown and playing John Jay - Cross River .
In the locker room before the game , DeMatteo told his players , " I want Johnny Spo to go home tonight so happy he ca nt sleep . " "
The kids went berserk clapping , " he said .
Somers won in a romp .
Maybe they would have , anyway .
Maybe not .
But John , who won the 12th Man Award at this years Section 1 dinner , had an impact that transcended the scoreboard .
Once the spring came around , John shifted his focus to competing inside of the lines . "
Track was the one sport he could compete in , " said Somers track and field coach Mike Sokolofsky . "
He got really excited about it .
It showed ( his teammates ) what life is about .
Anything they might go through , you can deal with it .
It really brought such a good attitude to the team . "
And John was not just a positive presence , but also a funny one .
Classmate Greg Fusco , who has known him since preschool , ran the 100-meter dashes behind him to help verbally steer him to the finish . "
He has never let it ( his vision ) get him down .
He always has a smile on his face .
He s always looking to make people laugh , " Fusco said . "
He s always cracking jokes before races : ' You d better not slow me down . " "
He called me during the ( July 4 Coney Island ) hot dog eating contest , " Sokolofsky said , chuckling . "
He said , ' This looks like something you d be good at . "
His dad just loved that he was always among friends and not home " wallowing in misery . "
John obviously has issues but he tries to be as normal as possible with his issues .
His support from his friends is just off the charts , " his father said , adding he could list 20 kids who have been there for his son . "
I did nt want to stay down .
Other people can have worse problems .
I still felt lucky , " John explained , adding of high school , " I did nt really miss out on anything . "

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is accusing the Department of Education of getting in the way of its lawsuit against a student loan giant .
The accusation from the consumer watchdog comes in a case the agency filed last year against Navient , alleging the student loan company caused borrowers to struggle unnecessarily by steering them towards repayment plans that were nt in their best interest and ignoring borrowers instructions about how their payments should be allocated , among other claims .
In a letter submitted to the judge overseeing the case this week , the CFPB claims that Navient is nt producing documents requested as part of the case that are " essential to identifying the universe of harmed consumers , " because they do nt have permission from the Department of Education .
The Department did nt respond to a request for comment on the case .
Though it seems like a wonky regulatory battle , the letter is the latest sign of the tussle between the Department of Education , state lawmakers and the CFPB over whether student loan companies relationship with the Department of Education shields them from other legal challenges .
Navient is also facing multiple suits from state law enforcement officials , including most recently , Californias attorney general .
Paying student loans for the first time ?
Here 's what you need to know Politico reported earlier this year that the Department instructed student loan companies not to respond directly to any third party without first seeking the agencys permission .
In the spring , another major student loan company filed a lawsuit against the state of Connecticuts Department of Banking , claiming that the state was requiring the firm to provide documents it did nt have permission from the Department of Education to release .
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos also released a memo earlier this year arguing that states ca nt regulate student loan companies hired by the federal government , because state laws governing the companies are superseded by federal regulations . "
It appears that Secretary DeVos is siding with one of the most complained about companies in America to try to obstruct the ability of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to enforce consumer protection law for student loan borrowers , " said Chris Peterson , a senior fellow at the Consumer Federation of America , an association of consumer advocacy organizations .
Navient officials have a different opinion on the reason for the dispute . "
This impasse is the result of the CFPB attempting to regulate the program of another federal agency , " Nikki Lavoie , a Navient spokesperson said in a statement .
Navient has previously denied the allegations brought in the suit and Lavoie argued in the statement that the CFPB has nt found evidence to support its claims against the company .
The request for the records " is an attempt to allow the search to continue , " she said .
In addition , Navients contract with the Department requires the company to get the agencys approval before sharing borrower data , she said .
On Friday , Navient filed its own letter to the judge in the case asking the court to hold an in - person conference regarding the issue and to give Department the opportunity to be heard on it . "
This issue is , fundamentally , a dispute between two agencies of the federal government , " an attorney representing Navient wrote .
According to the CFPB , the Department is citing the Privacy Act , which governs how federal agencies handle information they collect , as a justification for blocking the release of the Navient documents .
Though the goal of the Privacy Act is to make sure government agencies abide by fair information practices , it does allow disclosure in certain circumstances , including when another agency is requesting the information and if its part of a court order , said Peter Swire , a privacy expert and professor at Georgia Techs Scheller College of Business . "
The Privacy Act recognizes that other agencies might need the records and the Privacy Act creates a way for the requesting agency to get the records , " he said .
The Department and the CFPB have historically shared information about student loan companies , but the Department ended their information sharing agreement last year , calling the CFPB " overreaching and unaccountable . "
The corporate owners of the Mandalay Bay casino filed suit against the victims of last years Las Vegas concert mass shooting , claiming it has no liability for the massacre , according to a published report on Monday .
MGM Resorts International US : MGM went to federal courts in Nevada and California and took on more than 1,000 shooting victims , saying claims against the hotel giant " must be dismissed . " "
Plaintiffs have no liability of any kind to defendants , " the complaints argue , according to the Las Vegas Review - Journal .
Las Vegas lawyer Robert Eglet , who is representing several victims , told the paper that the hotels unusual action is a pre - emptive strike to get the cases heard in federal court instead of state court .
Englet said MGM must believe it has better chances of victory in a federal case .
The MGM lawsuits are a " blatant display of judge shopping " that " quite frankly verges on unethical , " according to Eglet . "
I ve never seen a more outrageous thing , where they sue the victims in an effort to find a judge they like , " the lawyer continued . "
Its just really sad that they would stoop to this level . "
An MGM spokeswoman said Monday of the companys lawsuits : " The Federal Court is an appropriate venue for these cases and provides those affected with the opportunity for a timely resolution .
Years of drawn out litigation and hearings are not in the best interest of victims , the community and those still healing . "
Mandalay Bay guest Stephen Paddock , on Oct. 1 last year , shot out the windows of his 32nd - floor room and opened fire on fans below attending the Route 91 Harvest music festival .
He killed 58 people and wounded more than 800 .
By the time cops stormed his room , Paddock had already killed himself and his motive for mass murder remains a mystery .
Lawsuits have been filed against both MGM and concert promoter Live Nation , accusing the companies of not have adequate security or properly trained staff .

The County Fire , which broke out on Saturday afternoon in rural Yolo County , west of Sacramento , blackened more than 70,000 acres ( 28,800 hectares ) of grass , brush and dense scrub oak .
That was 17 percent more than the 60,000 acres ( 24,280 hectares ) it had burned as of late Monday .
A wildfire in Northern California swelled on Tuesday , as firefighters battled the blaze that threatened hundreds of homes and other structures , sending thick black smoke across the San Francisco Bay Area .
Hot Shot crews from Truckee , Calif. , use incendiary devices to start backfires to help contain the County fire along Highway 129 , near Lake Berryessa in Yolo County , Calif. , on Tuesday , July 3 , 2018 .
The United States is in the midst of an unusually active fire season , with the risk significantly above normal for many western states , according to federal forecasters .
The County Fire was only 5 percent contained early on Tuesday , with more than 2,100 fire personnel battling the flames , the California Fire authority said .
The blaze threatened about 700 homes , a local NBC affiliate reported , as authorities issued evacuation orders and advisories to hundreds of residents .
The job of hand crews and bulldozer operators trying to cut containment lines was made more difficult by high winds , which were blowing embers and starting new fires , Scott McLean of the California Department of Forestry and Fire protection said . "
The potential for growth remains high as crews battle the fire in difficult terrain , " Cal Fire said in an advisory .
The smoke reached about 75 miles ( 120 km ) south to San Francisco , leaving a film of ash on cars and windows .
No casualties have been reported .
Wildfires have burned through nearly 2.5 million acres in the United States from Jan. 1 through Monday , well above an average of about 2.3 million for the same period over the last 10 years , according to the National Interagency Fire Center .
In Colorado , firefighters faced another day of hot temperatures , low humidity and gusting winds as they battled eight major blazes which have torched over 140,000 acres in the drought - stricken state .
The largest wildfire , the Spring Fire burning in southern Colorado , grew by 18,000 acres overnight , ballooning to nearly 79,000 acres .
It has destroyed at least 104 homes , forced the evacuations of several small communities , and closed a key mountain - pass road .
That fire was just 5 percent contained .
Danish national Jesper Joergensen , 52 , is suspected of starting the fire and is being held on first - degree arson charges .
He is in the country illegally and may face deportation , police said .
The Department of Justice said Tuesday that a family possibly containing U.S. citizens was separated as a part of immigration enforcement .
The revelation comes as the Department of Justice struggles to meet a federal judge 's deadlines for reuniting nearly 3,000 children separated from their families , most under the president 's " zero tolerance " immigration policy that went into full effect in May. On Tuesday , government officials filed a joint status update with the American Civil Liberties Union containing reunification scenarios for 102 children under the age of 5 .
The document says that one child can not be reunited because the parent 's location " has been unknown for more than a year . "
The document states , " records show the parent and child might be U.S. citizens . "
Lee Gelernt , the deputy director of the ACLUs Immigrants Rights Project , criticized the government 's record keeping , according to The Guardian . "
It actually happens much more frequently than you would believe , " he said . "
They ( Immigration and Customs Enforcement ) make mistakes . "
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ordered that 63 children under age 5 be reunited by Tuesday night .
All other minors must be reunited by July 26 , he has ruled .
Department of Justice lawyers asked for an extension of Tuesday 's deadline , saying federal agencies acted as quickly as possible but face a daunting challenge that includes complicated cases .
During a court hearing Tuesday , Sabraw told the government his deadlines were firm , not " aspirational goals . "

The Dow is trying to make it five up sessions in a row , while gold heads in the other direction .
The metals retreat has hampered gold mining shares , but our call of the day from a " True Contrarian " suggests sticking with those stocks .

Dow aims for best win streak in 2 months as Morgan Stanley reports quarterly results The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday is set to make a run at a fourth rise in as many sessions as investors await a second day of congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell .
See full story .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average late - morning Friday retouched a psychologically round - number level above 25,000 for the first time in about a month , as investors focused on corporate results and pushed some concerns about global trade disputes to the back burner .
The Dow DJIA , -1.34 % , most recently , was up 85 points , or 0.4 % , at 25,009 , a modest gain but enough to propel it above the psychological threshold which may underpin enthusiasm for assets perceived as risky , even as the market wrestles with worries over geopolitical clashes , notably over import duties , between the U.S. and its major developed partners in Asia , North America and Europe .
The gains come after a round of second - quarter results from JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , -0.59 % , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , -1.19 % and Citigroup Inc. C , -1.85 % , which came in mixed early Friday before the open .
Meanwhile , the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % rose 0.2 % at 2,803 , and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , -1.83 % edged up by 0.1 % at 7,834 , touching a fresh intraday peak for the technology - laden gauge at 7,838.13 .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average late - morning Wednesday was trading near its highest level of the session , with its gains powered by UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH , +0.03 % and Boeing Co. BA , -4.88 % .
Shares of the UnitedHealth and Boeing were contributing a combined 54 points to the price - weighted Dow DJIA , -1.34 % .
The benchmark most recently was up about 40 points , or 0.2 % , at 25,159 , trading near session highs .
UnitedHealth 's shares were up about $ 4.19 , or 1.7 % , while those for industrial giant Boeing were climbing by $ 3.88 or more than 1 % .
A $ 1 move in any one of the Dow 's components translates to a roughly 6.8-point swing in the equity gauge .
Meanwhile , the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % was virtually flat on the day , while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , -1.83 % was down by about 0.2 % .
The down - on - his - luck investor may take comfort in history , however .
Fellow value - style champion Julian Robertson of Tiger Management had his own high - profile stumble during the momentum - driven tech stock surge of 1999 and 2000 , a period that preceded a big shift back to value investing .
His Greenlight Capital fund fell 7.7 percent in June and was down nearly 19 percent for the first half of the year , according to a performance update seen by CNBC .
At the same time , the S&P 500 was up 1.7 percent .
That could mean value investing , which has been in the doldrums during the current strong run - up in tech stocks , could be about to come back in style .
Investors just have to hang in there long enough .
Robert Buckland of Citi Research said in a note to clients on Wednesday that as a bull market runs its course , its winning bets typically narrow to high - growth and momentum stocks , a shift he saw in the current market in February . "
This usually favors growth and momentum trades and has produced bubbles in the past , " he wrote . "
These can be career - threatening for value managers . "
Four out of Greenlight 's five - largest disclosed positions , revealed in the first - quarter investor letter , are down through the end of June .
Among them , Brighthouse Financial leads with a 30 percent drop .
And Einhorn 's bets against high - flying technology and growth stocks , the so - called the bubble basket , have backfired on him .
The weak year - to - date return followed a meager 1.6 percent gain in 2017 versus a 19.4 percent gain for the S&P 500 , according to an investor letter .
Greenlight did not respond to a request for comment .
Einhorn is n't alone among out - of - favor value investors .
The S&P 500 Growth index rose 6.6 percent in the first half of this year , while the S&P 500 Value index declined 3.4 percent .
And the market still favors big tech stocks .
Amazon was up 45 percent , Netflix had gained 104 percent and Tesla was up 10 percent so far this year through June .
All are in the " bubble basket " of stocks Einhorn 's Greenlight has bet against .
If the investor did n't exit those positions , the same basket of stocks likely contributed to the fund 's losses this year .
Earlier this year , Einhorn expressed confidence in his fund 's stock positions . "
We believe our investment theses remain intact .
Despite recent results , our portfolio should perform well over time , " Einhorn said in a April 3 letter to clients . "
To some extent , this quarter 's result stems from the continued extreme outperformance of growth over value . "
While Einhorn waits for a shift back to a less extreme imbalance of growth and value , his struggles are reminiscent of those experienced by the most successful value - oriented hedge fund of the 1980s and 1990s .
Back then , Robertsons Tiger Management posted annual returns of more than 30 percent for 18 years and reached assets under management of more than $ 20 billion .
But then the hedge fund faltered as value stocks went out of favor and internet stocks boomed .
Tiger lost 19 percent in 1999 , the same year that earlier generation of technology stocks soared .
But Robertson did not wait it out .
As investors withdrew $ 7.7 billion from Tiger , Robertson decided to close his firm after a nearly 15 percent drop in the first two months of 2000 . "
The result of the demise of value investing and investor withdrawals has been financial erosion , stressful to us all , " Robertson wrote in an investor letter on March 30 , 2000 . "
And there is no real indication that a quick end is in sight . "
Robertson said his success had been his steady commitment to buying the best stocks and shorting the worst . "
In a rational environment , this strategy functions well .
But in an irrational market , where earnings and price considerations take a back seat to mouse clicks and momentum , such logic , as we have learned , does not count for much . "
Tigers closure was right around the peak of the technology - heavy Nasdaq composite , which would turn quickly and drop 46 percent from April to year - end 2000 .
When that dot - com bubble burst , value stocks came back into fashion .
From April 2000 to year - end 2003 , the S&P 500 Value index outperformed the S&P 500 Growth index by 30 percentage points .
History may repeat itself .
The Editorial Board USA TODAY As NATO leaders gathered in Brussels this week to be severely lectured by America 's mercurial president -- who gets some things right about the organization , but a whole lot else wrong -- it 's worth recalling what the alliance represents .
First and foremost , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the largest and most successful assemblage of allies in history , projecting strength from a single , elegant premise : that an attack on one member is an attack on all .
Created from the ashes of World War II as a way to end European wars and serve as a bulwark against a menacing Soviet Union , the original 12-member alliance worked even better than imagined .
For about seven decades , Europe prospered in relative peace .
The Soviet Union collapsed .
And as NATO grew -- to 29 nations , with each new entrant committed to democracy , individual liberty and the rule of law -- freedom flourished .
That 's not just good for Europe .
It 's also good for the U.S. America no longer rushes troops overseas to die on European battlefields every generation , and the European Union is now our largest trading partner .
As Defense Secretary James Mattis put it during his Senate confirmation : " If we did not have NATO today , we would need to create it . "
RAND PAUL : We should be aware of Russia 's perspective COLUMN : It 's time to restructure NATO Someone needs to tell that to Mattis ' boss , President Donald Trump .
Despite Trump 's relentless carping about burden - sharing , the alliance has invoked its collective - defense provision just once in almost 70 years : to defend America after 9/11 .
NATO forces , fighting alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan , paid their commitment in blood , suffering a thousand battlefield deaths in the years since .
Bipartisan support for NATO is so strong that a Senate resolution supporting the alliance passed 97 - 2 on Tuesday .
None of this means the alliance is without problems .
Turkey and other members have been backsliding on democracy .
And Trump , correctly , questions defense spending shortfalls by some countries .
This is particularly true of Germany , where troops lack necessary equipment and more of the tanks and submarines are not battle ready , despite that nation 's healthy economy .
His complaints , like President Barack Obama 's before him , motivated NATO members to increase defense spending since 2014 , when Russia annexed Crimea .
But these differences are typically handled diplomatically , behind the scenes .
Trump publicly antagonizes in a way that no U.S. president has done before .
He talks like America 's running a protection racket and nations are n't forking over payoffs .
He insults Germany as " totally controlled by " and " captive " to Russia because of a natural gas pipeline deal . "
Many countries owe us a tremendous amount of money from many years back where they re delinquent ... because the United States has had to pay for them , " Trump said before television cameras in a hectoring lecture to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday .
That 's not even close to being true .
Trump is loosely talking about money each nation spends on its defense budget as a percentage of its economy .
NATO countries agreed to a defense spending guideline of 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024 and are stillfalling short , though an increasing number are achieving that goal .
The money is n't paid to the United States and , in any event , it can be a misleading metric .
Greece , for example , spends 2.36 percent of GDP on defense , mainly because its economy has shrunk and much of that money goes for military pensions .
France , meanwhile , falls short with 1.79 percent of GDP , but invests heavily in fighting terror overseas alongside the United States .
Despite Trump 's harangue in Brussels , the NATO leaders reaffirmed efforts to defend against Russian aggression and Islamic terrorism .
Yet the U.S. president 's truculent attacks on close friends risk serious damage to the greatest alliance America has ever known -- to the great delight of Russian President Vladimir Putin , who wants nothing more than to weaken and splinter the West .

The FAANG stocks have been dominant during the nine - year bull market .
But that also means they may get more punished than the broader market when the bull dies .
Scott Crowe , the chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management in Plymouth Meeting , Pa. , makes a case that based on valuations and history , commercial real estate will be a good hedge against a decline for big tech .
In an interview July 10 , Crowe pointed out that valuations for real estate investment trusts have been declining relative to the entire U.S. stock market : CenterSquare Investment Management This chart shows the valuation ( price to funds from operations , or FFO ) of the NAREIT Equity REITs Index to the aggregate price - to - earnings ratio for all U.S. stocks for 20 years through the end of March .
You can see that the real estate investment trusts relative valuation has declined significantly since peaking in early 2012 . (
FFO adds depreciation and amortization back to earnings , while subtracting gains on asset sales .
It is a non - GAAP figure that is used in the REIT industry to measure dividend - paying ability . )
The chart comes from CenterSquares recent report on REIT valuations .
Heres a comparison of valuations for REITs against the FAANG stocks and U.S. commercial real estate as of the end of March : CenterSquare Investment Management The valuation bar for the FAANG group of companies -- Facebook US : FB , Amazon.com US : AMZN , Apple US : AAPL , Netflix US : NFLX and Google holding company Alphabet US : GOOG US : GOOGL -- is distorted by the extremely high price - to - earnings ratios for Amazon and Netflix .
To put things in better perspective , heres a comparison of current P / E valuations for the FAANGs and the S&P 1500 real estate sector : Ticker Price / consensus earnings estimate for next 12 months Facebook Inc. US : FB 24.3 Amazon.com Inc. US : AMZN 107.2 Apple Inc. US : AAPL 15.0 Netflix Inc. US : NFLX 109.5 Alphabet Inc. Class C US : GOOG 25.1 Alphabet Inc. Class A US : GOOGL 25.3 S&P 1500 Real Estate Sector ( price/ FFO ) 16.5 Source : FactSet Except for Apple , the FAANG valuations are significantly higher than the price / FFO valuation for the real estate sector .
For a further comparison , the S&P 500 Index US : SPX trades for 16.5 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months and the forward price - to - earnings ratio for the S&P 1500 Composite Index ( made up of the S&P 500 , the S&P 400 Mid Cap Index US : MID and the S&P 600 Small Cap Index US : SML ) is 16.6 .
A comparison of FAANG and property values This chart from CenterSquare shows the value of the FAANG companies compared to that of all U.S. commercial real estate : CenterSquare Investment Management As of the end of March , the FAANG stocks were worth more than half the total value of all U.S. commercial property , according to CenterSquares data sources . "
The flavor du jour of the equity market changes over time , but commercial real estate endures , " Crowe said .
REITs outperform after market downturns Heres how REITs performed following the bursting of the dot - com bubble in 2000 and the financial crisis of 2008 : CenterSquare Investment Management Crowe did not predict when the current bull market might end , but the performance pattern following the past two prolonged periods of general decline for U.S. equities makes a sound argument for diversifying your portfolio .
Retail fears are a distraction When asked about investors bias against retail property as more shopping activity moves online , Crowe said that " about one - third of the retail space in the U.S. needs to be shuttered or repurposed . "
But he also said " the retail you want to worry about , " which includes low - quality shopping malls and shopping centers , as well as big - box stores , only makes up about 1.5 % of the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index .
He argued that investors concerns about declining prospects for retail real estate was already " priced into " higher - quality REITs , including Simon Property Group US : SPG , the largest holding of the AMG Managers CenterSquare Real Estate Fund US : MRESX as of May 31 .
Crowe said only about 15 % of the funds investments are in retail REITs , and gave examples of REITs the fund holds that are benefiting from technology and the evolution of consumer habits : * The largest tenant of properties held by Prologis US : PLD is Amazon .
This REIT focuses on industrial distribution -- warehouses . *
Equinix US : EQIX runs data centers in the U.S. , Japan and Europe , providing cloud services to more than 9,800 companies . *
Kilroy Realty US : KRC owns , develops and manages office and mixed - use real estate on the West Coast of the U.S. , with a focus on the " creative office . "

The Facebook Inc. FB , -4.27 % data set related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal was accessed from Russia , according to a CNN report late Tuesday .
Facebook stock was flat in after hours trading .
Citing Conservative member of parliament Damian Collins , CNN reported that the Facebook data touching 87 million people was accessed from Russia and other countries .
It was not immediately clear who accessed the data and what specifically was accessed .

The FBI has arrested a man who it said planned to bomb Cleveland 's Fourth of July celebrations and then stand by and watch " it go off , " federal officials said on Monday .
Demetrius Pitts , 48 , who had expressed allegiance to the al Qaeda militant group , was arrested on Sunday after a meeting with an undercover FBI agent where he said he planned to plant a bomb at a parade celebrating the U.S. Independence Day holiday and intended to target other locations in Cleveland and Philadelphia .
Many major American cities mark the holiday with fireworks and parades , and typically ramp up security around such events .
An undercover FBI agent helped Pitts pick the location for his planned attack , near a planned fireworks show and multiple U.S. government buildings , the FBI said . "
I m gon na be downtown when the - when the thing go off .
I m gon na be somewhere cuz I wanna see it go off , " Pitts told an undercover FBI agent who he believed was affiliated with al Qaeda , the FBI said in court documents .
Pitts also suggested giving the children of military personnel remote control cars packed with explosives during the parade so the kids would unwittingly detonate the bombs , the FBI said .
Pitts was charged with attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization .
He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted .
An FBI source gave Pitts a bus pass and a phone to conduct surveillance ahead of his planned attack , prosecutors said .
Pitts , who lives in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights , also discussed possibly traveling to San Francisco for reconnaissance for al Qaeda , the FBI said .
It was not immediately clear if he had retained a lawyer , and relatives could not be reached for comment . "
This defendant , by his own words and by his own deeds , wanted to attack our nation and its ideals , " said Justin Herdman , the U.S. attorney for northern Ohio .
Officials said Pitts is an American citizen who had been radicalized in the United States .
In 2015 , U.S. law enforcement officials said they had arrested more than 10 people inspired by the Islamic State militant group ahead of the Fourth of July holiday , saying the arrests had disrupted planned attacks .
A pair of ethnic Chechen brothers inspired by al Qaeda killed three people and injured more than 260 with a pair of homemade bombs at the Boston Marathon in 2013 .
The federal judge who ordered the reunification of children separated from their families along the Mexican border is the son of a Japanese immigrant .
The government acknowledged it failed to meet Tuesday 's deadline set by U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw to reunite about 100 children under age 5 with their families after they were seized along the Mexican border when their parents were arrested for illegally entering the U.S. Dana Sabraw , based in San Diego , last month gave the government 14 days to reunite children under 5 , some of whom had been separated from their families for weeks .
He allowed 30 days for older kids .
So who is this guy ?
His Federal Bar Association profile and his own legal rulings shine some light .
More:3 young migrant children reunited with their dads in El Paso More : Mexicans comprise a bigger share of border prosecutions His mother is an immigrant Sabraw 's father met his mother while he was a soldier stationed in Japan during the Korean War .
They were married in her native Japan before settling in San Rafael , California , where the Sabraw was born in 1958 .
He was given a Japanese middle name - Makoto - in honor of his mothers family .
The name translates to " true " or " truth . "
Athlete , parade star , Bush appointee Sabraw played baseball , wrestled and ran track in high school .
During his senior year , he served as grand marshall of Sacramentos annual Camellia Festival Parade .
After graduating from San Diego State in 1980 , he took a year off before law school and tooled around in country in a 66 Rambler .
Then it was on to the University of the Pacific 's McGeorge School of Law .
He worked in private practice until becoming a municipal judge in 1995 .
President George W. Bush nominated him to the federal bench in 2003 , and he won unanimous Senate confirmation .
His wife just won an election Sabraw 's wife , Summer Stephan , has been a prosecutor for almost three decades .
She was appointed San Diego County 's interim district attorney a year ago , and in June was elected to the post .
Last year , a Women In The World profile compared her to Olivia Benson , the detective on NBCs " Law & Order : Special Victims Unit . "
The couple met in law school and has three kids .
How he got involved in this case The ACLU filed suit in March against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency , and Sabraw was assigned the case .
The suit sought to reunite an asylum - seeking mother identified as " Ms. L " and her 7-year - old daughter fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
They were separated in the U.S. and detained separately 2,000 miles apart .
The lawsuit cites violations of the Constitutions due process clause , federal law protecting asylum seekers and the governments own directive to keep families intact . "
Ms. L " and her daughter were reunited months ago , but the national class - action lawsuit continues .
How is the case going ?
At a status hearing Tuesday , Sabraw said he was encouraged by the progress being made by the Trump administration .
But he demanded that the government adopt a " streamlined approach " for vetting families . "
These are firm deadlines , " he said . "
They re not aspirational goals . "
The Federal Reserve Bank and the bond market are at odds over the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation .
Despite two hikes of the Federal Funds rate this year , ranging between 1.75 percent and 2.0 percent , long - term rates have not kept pace , causing the yield curve to flatten and stoking fears of a recession . " [
Federal Reserve Bank ] Chairman Powell is bullish on the economy , but were concerned he s overly bullish on the pace of rate hikes , " said George Rusnak , co - head of global fixed - income strategy at Wells Fargo .
He worries that a newly aggressive Fed could hasten a downturn in the currently strong economy . "
The market does nt think the future growth and inflation are there . "
The U.S. Federal Reserve building in Washington , D.C. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Like many market analysts , Rusnak is troubled by the flattening yield curve .
The curve plots the interest rates of Treasury bills and bonds against their duration .
In a healthy economy the curve slopes upward and investors are paid more to lend money for longer periods as reward for taking the risk that inflation and interest rates will move higher .
When spreads between short- and long - term rates narrow , it suggests that the market believes economic growth and inflation are not sustainable and will fall in the future .
The spread between the yields of the 2-year Treasury note ( 2.55 percent ) and 10-year Treasury note ( 2.89 percent ) was 34 basis points on June 23 .
That s less than half of what it was in early February and the narrowest its been since August 2007 .
An inversion of the curve -- when long - term rates fall below short - term -- traditionally indicates a looming recession .
The newly appointed Fed Chairman is already facing criticism for increasing that risk . "
Chairman Powell is being too bold as head of an institution that requires careful management , " said Guy Petcho , global macroeconomic portfolio manager for Voya Financial . "
The Fed is dismissing the signal of the market , but the market will force it to pay attention . "

It 's a myth Choose your ' trusted contact ' for financial matters carefully An inverted yield curve spooks investors a lot more than the Fed .
Every recession since the 1950s has been preceded by a curve inversion .
While the lag between inversion and recession has varied between six months and two years , the one has always followed the other , with only one exception in the mid-1960s . "
Historically , an inverted curve has been the single best indicator of market expectations , " said Thanos Bardas , a managing director at Neuberger Berman . "
The pattern moves from higher inflation to excessive tightening to an inversion and then a recession . "
Normally , the Fed intends for that pattern to occur in order to slow an overheating economy .
With inflation finally trending near the Feds stated target of 2 percent , however , it can hardly be characterized as high .
Bardas , too , believes that the Fed should be responsive to market forces and not risk an inversion of the yield curve . "
If the curve continues to flatten , the Fed may need to pause [ its rate hikes ] , " he said .
Why is the yield curve flattening ?
The simple answer is the rapid rise of the 2-year Treasury yield .
It has risen much faster than changes in the Fed funds rate because the market now believes that the Feds policy path is more certain given the strong economy . "
We ve had eight years of growth consistently coming in under estimate , " said Jeffrey Rosenberg , chief fixed - income strategist for BlackRock . "
Now GDP growth is exceeding the Feds expectations and the market is adjusting by narrowing the uncertainty discount . "
The three - year forward Fed funds rate is now at 2.7 percent , meaning the market expects the Fed to raise rates three more times this cycle .
The 2-year Treasury yield has priced in most of the expected Fed tightening .
While Fed policy is the major mover of the 2-year Treasury yield , a wider range of factors are influencing the behavior of the 10-year bond .
For one thing , the Fed and central banks around the world have been buying up government debt for years , effectively depressing long - term interest rates .
The Fed is now reducing its holdings of government bonds by not reinvesting a growing volume of maturing bonds .
The pace of the unwind is currently $ 30 billion per month and will rise to $ 50 billion in the fourth quarter .
The lower demand will ultimately serve to reduce prices on long bonds and raise yields , but the passive strategy is having an unintended impact on the yield curve , said Rosenberg .
As near - term maturities roll off the balance sheet , the short end of the curve is not getting support while the government continues to hold its longer - term bonds . "
Its effectively still Operation Twist , " said Rosenberg , referring to the Feds strategy of selling short - term Treasury bills to buy long - term Treasury bonds first implemented in 2011 .
Much of the Treasurys issuance of debt so far this year has been in the form of short - term bills , adding further pressure for the yield curve to flatten .
Its one thing to prepare for the next downturn , and another to cause the next downturn .

The first caller up on Paul Finebaums SEC Network show Monday wanted , naturally , to talk about SEC football .
But first , Phillip from Memphis had a message for the host . "
Most importantly , I want to tell you , and I ve been trying to follow the controversy or the questions about your career , " Phillip said . "
I just wanted to tell you wherever you go , whatever you do , your friends are gon na follow .
They re going to miss the connection with the SEC , but if you wind up as the docent of the Patriot League or wherever you go , well find you . "
Then it was Millie from Rolla , Mo. , who seems to call in at some point darn near every day , and on this day had a pointed message for Finebaum , who is as closely associated with the SEC as any sports media personality is with a conference . "
I hope you stay with the studio because if you do nt , Ill never watch the SEC again ! "
she declared .
More : Saban 's QB decision will be ' for the good ' of Alabama More : The best running backs in college football for 2018 As the SEC prepares for its annual Media Days kickoff event next week , the biggest story in the league has nothing to do with a player or coach .
Instead , its whether a bald , bespectacled former newspaper columnist is on the verge of leaving the SEC Network and taking both his influential show and devoted audience of listeners somewhere else -- perhaps even to the Big Ten .
Though the thought of Finebaum abandoning the SEC for the Big Ten might seem ridiculous for someone who was tabbed " King of the South " by the New Yorker , wrote a book titled " My Conference Can Beat Your Conference " and seems take a fair amount of pleasure in bashing Michigans Jim Harbaugh , the facts are these .
Finebaums contract with the ESPN - owned SEC Network runs out at the end of this month .
There are multiple reports , citing anonymous people , indicating that negotiations between Finebaums representatives and the network have been contentious .
And if Finebaum were to become a free agent , he would have some interesting and unique suitors .
According to the Sporting News , that would include Fox , which co - owns the Big Ten Network .
Reached by phone Tuesday , Finebaum declined comment on his future , other than to say he expects to be on set Monday in Atlanta when SEC Media Days begins .
One person familiar with the matter from the ESPN side , who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the discussions , called the story overblown and said the speculation of his departure was unsubstantiated .
Even if Finebaum and ESPN ca nt come to terms by next week , the plan seems to be business as usual .
But that would be wholly unrealistic because , as absurd as it may seem to those who are nt deeply connected to the culture of the SEC , Finebaums potential departure would hang over the entire event .
And its not so much that the SEC would fall apart if Finebaum left its main propaganda arm ( it certainly would nt ) or that Nick Saban would stop winning championships if Finebaum took his talents elsewhere .
Its the sense that for as much as the SEC has changed in the past decade - its become bigger , more corporate ; even media day itself is moving to Atlanta from its longtime home in Birmingham - Finebaums show and the cast of characters who populate its orbit are one of the few remaining connections between an increasingly sterile , personality - defunct league and its colorful , blue - collar fan base .
Not only that , ESPN making Finebaum the SEC Networks premiere personality when it launched in 2014 kind of elevated those fans to objects of fascination , the very existence of which explained to the country why the SEC was different from other leagues . "
I m sure there are 20-somethings in Connecticut who sit there and watch five minutes and are aghast and have no idea what it is they re seeing , " said Cecil Hurt , the longtime columnist and sports editor of the Tuscaloosa News . "
There was a time in history and technology where that fan had no Twitter to go on , no Facebook to go on , so they called radio shows .
For a certain segment of a very devoted college football fan base in the SEC , Paul is just part of it , and there are nt many 25-year old traditions out there anymore .
There s not much that connects today with SEC football as it was in 1995 , and Paul is that link . "
More than likely , Finebaum will continue to be that link .
The prevailing sense within the industry is that Finebaum and ESPN will find a way to get a deal done because , if nothing else , it makes little sense to end a relationship that has been good for both sides .
In the meantime , Finebaum will likely have to continue listening to the tributes from callers while revealing very little about the situation until the future of his show is certain .
As he said on his show Monday : " I think its all going to work out great . "
The Food and Drug Administration is forming a new task force to focus on why the U.S. has so many drug shortages , and what solutions may be possible .
Though the regulator has made progress in addressing shortages , " we must work to find new and creative ways to tackle the issue , " Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Thursday .
New drug shortages have declined in recent years , particularly since 2011 , when 250 new shortages were reported , but they " continue to pose a real challenge to public health , " according to an FDA report . "
This is especially the case when a shortage involves a critical drug to treat cancer , to provide parenteral nutrition , or to address another serious medical condition , such as the shortage of intravenous saline solution . "
High - profile drug shortages in the last few years have included injectable painkillers , IV fluids and , most recently , EpiPens .
Read more : There s a shortage of U.S. EpiPens and other allergic reaction treatments The FDA initiative , called the Drug Shortages Task Force , will be led by Keagan Lenihan , the FDAs associate commissioner for strategic initiatives , and will include representatives of the FDA , Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs .
Last year , drug production issues in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey , Irma and , particularly , Maria , resulted in new shortages and added to existing ones , the FDA report said .
In particular , generic medicines have low margins , and because of industry consolidation , errors can have significant consequences , Gottlieb said .
Solutions might include encouraging manufacturing investments for generic medications , re - evaluating reimbursement for certain drugs and creating a " critical drugs list " of products that are especially important to have in supply , he said .
The Food and Drug Administration issued a voluntary recall late Friday of high - blood pressure and heart drugs containing the ingredient valsartan because of impurity issues .
Affected companies include Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. TEVA , -0.85 % , Solco Healthcare , and Major Pharmaceuticals , the FDA said .
The agency said valsartan used in the affected products contained N - nitrosodimethylamine , which is classified as a probable human carcinogen . "
We have carefully assessed the valsartan - containing medications sold in the United States , and we 've found that the valsartan sold by these specific companies does not meet our safety standards , " said Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research , in a statement .

The housing market may be starting to benefit from the one thing that can loosen a long - running squeeze that has crimped sales and driven up prices : more homes .
The nations housing inventory increased 12.2 percent in the second quarter , the biggest gain since early 2015 , according to real estate research firm Trulia .
Housing supplies were still down 5.3 percent from a year ago , a dynamic that has continued to push up prices .
But that s less than the double - digit annual declines that had prevailed since the second quarter of 2017 and the smallest drop since early 2017 .
Thirty of the nations 100 largest metro areas saw their housing supplies increase on an annual basis last quarter .
That s up from just 13 early in the year and represents the largest share of big cities with rising inventories in more than three years . "
It could be the start of a shift in inventory , " says Trulia data analyst Alexandra Lee , though she added its too early to tell for sure .

5 cities where homes sold the fastest -- and the 5 slowest She attributed the increase to an acceleration in new home construction as well as the willingness of more existing homeowners to put their houses on the market .
Some , she says , want to benefit from big price gains on the assumption that housing prices may be peaking .
And baby boomers who have stayed in their homes while delaying retirement may be hanging it up in greater numbers .
The Nashville , Tennessee , area led the nation in the second quarter with a 52 percent jump in homes on the market compared with a year earlier , Trulia figures show .
The median home price of $ 255,000 is still up 11.3 percent annually , according to Zillow , an online real estate database firm .
But , " there has been some more inventory , " says John McClanahan , a broker for Village Real Estate in Nashville .
As a result , he says : " Prices have been really stable the last few months .
Things are a little slower .
You re not seeing as many multiple offers .
There s not as much of a frenzy . "
McClanahan cited a flurry of new home construction , with builders tearing down older single - family houses and putting up two new units on the same lot to reap a sufficient profit as land prices soar in the economically vibrant area .
The units are being snapped up by millennial first - time homebuyers as well as retiring baby boomers who are downsizing , he says .
Other top metro areas with big inventory gains the past year include Salt Lake City ( 48.6 percent ) , Dallas ( 32.4 percent ) , Washington , D.C. ( 21.9 percent ) , and Little Rock , Arkansas ( 13.4 percent ) , according to the Trulia data .
Meanwhile , home supplies also rose in six of the nations 10 most unaffordable cities where housing costs make up 42 percent or more of monthly income , Trulia says .
Inventory increased 1.1 percent in New York City , 2.9 percent in Los Angeles , 3.1 percent in Miami and 22.1 percent in San Diego .
The gains could help moderate price increases in the months and years ahead if they 're sustained , Lee says .
The Houston Astros got a walk - off 6 - 5 win in the 11th inning over the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night on as bizarre a play as any seasoned baseball fan will ever see .
Alex Bregman came to the plate with one out , and Kyle Tucker standing on second base and Tony Kemp on first after the Astros tied the score at 5 - 5 .
Bregman hit a ball that ricocheted off home plate , briefly rolled in foul territory and then rolled fair .
A 's catcher Jonathan Lucroy picked up the ball , turned around and dropped the ball as he attempted to tag Bregman out .
Bregman took off for first , and after fumbling with the ball for a moment Lucroy threw to first baseman Mark Canha .
The throw appeared to carom off Bregman 's batting helmet and into foul territory .
Tucker sprinted home with the game - winning run to complete the wild finish to the game .
The Athletics challenged the play , but the call on the field was upheld .
Bregman -- who had two home runs in the game -- called his 11th inning swing " the biggest circus of the whole thing , " and added : " I think it was the softest ball anyone 's ever hit . "
Prior to that insane sequence , Josh Reddick had scored the tying run after A 's shortshop Marcus Semien tried to throw Reddick out at home on a ball hit by Kemp .
This is n't the first time that Bregman has been involved in a mind - boggling walk - off play this season .
On April 7 , Bregman hit a shallow pop fly that San Diego Padres first baseman Eric Hosmer overran , which allowed the winning run to score .

The inverted yield curve is the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse of the economy -- investors fear them because in the past they have often preceded recessions .
Strategists at Morgan Stanley on Thursday predicted the yield curve will invert by the middle of 2019 , although they stopped short of issuing a recession warning .
An inverted yield curve is where long - term yields , typically the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.435 % , move below short - term rates , and tends to indicate a lack of confidence in the economy in the near term .
The spread between the two durations has steadily narrowed this year , in part because of the Federal Reserves move to hike interest rates in keeping with its effort to normalize monetary policy .

At its March 2019 meeting , we expect the Fed to ( 1 ) raise the effective federal funds rate target range by 25 basis points to 2.25 - 2.50 % , ( 2 ) lower interest on reserves within the range by 5 basis points , and ( 3 ) announce that it will begin implementing its plan to end balance sheet normalization in April , " they wrote .
The strategists predicted the 10-year treasury yield will be at 2.7 % by the end of 2018 , versus 2.85 % currently , and 2.50 % by mid-2019 , resulting in an inverted curve .
They also warned that investors are underestimating the size of the System Open Market Account required to keep EFFR within the Feds target range .
The SOMA is a portfolio of assets that the central bank buys in open - market operations . "
We expect the SOMA portfolio to be just above $ 3.8 trillion at the end of 2020 , assuming the Fed does not take rates to the zero lower bound by then , " said the strategists . "
Our projection assumes that balance sheet normalization ends in September 2019 . "
As such , Morgan Stanley is recommending investors to overweight Treasurys and underweight corporate bonds .
The last earnings season was all about raising expectations for earnings on the back of corporate tax cuts , share buybacks , and a synchronous global economic expansion .
A lot has changed in the last three months , according to Nick Raich of Earnings Scout . "
Last earnings season it was all about raising estimates .
This earnings season , all we want to see is companies maintain their EPS estimates . "
That may seem like a real downgrade in expectations , but Raich disagrees .
Second quarter earnings for the are expected to increase by 20 percent , not far off the first quarter 's 26 percent growth .
And estimates of 23 percent and 20 percent growth for the third and fourth quarter have not dropped at all .
Despite all the worries about trade wars , companies still seem comfortable with the earnings guidance they gave earlier in the year . "
If they are comfortable with that , that is bullish for stocks , " Raich told CNBC .
Still , you have to marvel at the strength of the market .
Stocks have shrugged off almost everything .
Just look at the rally on Monday .
Stocks surged on the absence of any bad headlines about trade wars .
Given that global trade has been the main sentiment mover in the last three months , and that the heated rhetoric has not really abated , just quieted down , you would think the markets would have a much more muted reaction .
This is obviously dangerous territory .
The market has come to believe that cooler heads will prevail on global trade .
Christine Short , who has watched this all unfold for Estimize , believes it makes sense . "
Everyone knows global trade is good for earnings , and to get into a global trade war means that every country is going to shave a bit off GDP growth , and that many companies are going have to lower earnings growth , and no one wants that , " she told CNBC .
It goes beyond trade , however : The market is pricing in a lot of good news .
1 .
The Fed : While global growth estimates are marginally lower , strong U.S. growth estimates are little changed , and the markets seem to believe they will stay that way .
With inflation still relatively muted this has put the Fed is in a " dovish box " that will prevent it from aggressively raising interest rates .
2 .
Growth over Value : Traders believe that technology -- the mother of all growth stories -- will continue to put up outsized gains .
With technology at a 25 percent weighting in the S&P 500 , far and away the biggest sector , and again expected to grow earnings 25 percent in the second quarter , " You need tech to keep growing , " Short said .
She thinks tech will likely deliver , and not just FAANG names .
Smaller companies in the enterprise space like Hubspot , Zendesk , Workday and Salesforce have also been doing well .
3 .
Shrugging off higher costs : The market will occasionally get into a mini - funk over higher commodity costs , or rising rates , or a higher dollar , but it has not yet translated into prolonged negative trading action .
What could derail this rosy scenario ?
For Nick Raich , it will all depend on corporate guidance : " If we see earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarter drop below 20 percent growth , that would be bearish in my mind , " he told CNBC .

The manager of Tallahassees Academy Sports was fired Tuesday after tackling a suspect accused of stealing a handgun last week .
The suspect also allegedly threatened to shoot people .
Dean Crouch , 32 , was the store manager who stopped Jason White from leaving the Mahan Drive store with a .40-caliber pistol from the firearms counter on June 29 . "
Academy has decided to , instead of treating him like the hero he is , they terminated his employment effective immediately because he put his hands on Mr. White , " Crouch 's attorney Ryan Hobbs said .
Just hours before he was taken into custody , White stole two handguns from Cash America Pawn on South Adams Street , according to Tallahassee Police .
More : Armed robbers torture 7-year - old boy during Texas home invasion White asked to look at the handgun at the firearms counter .
He was handed the gun , then ran toward the front door .
Crouch , who court records say observed the transaction at the counter , and another employee tackled and subdued White at the exit doors and recovered the gun , a stolen backpack , five boxes of ammunition and two magazines for the Glock .
White was taken into the stores office while police were en route .
It was there that he admitted to stealing the gun and threatened to shoot people with it .
Court records indicate those threats , but do not mention threats to kill police officers as Crouchs attorney claims .
White , according to court records , said he and his family were being threatened by an unknown person and he wanted the gun to " kill him . " "
He repeatedly said ' I stole and I admit to it and ' I will steal again when I get out of jail , " officers wrote in their report .

The way he sees it , Crouch may have saved lives by stopping White . "
This is not something that happens for Mr. Crouch in his everyday life , " Hobbs said . "
I think he was thinking there is a man running out of the store with a gun in his hand with his coworkers following from the firearm area screaming ' Stop that man .
Something had to be done and he was the one that was going to do it . "
Academy Sports spokeswoman Elise Hasbrook said she could not comment on specific personnel matters or policies .
However , Crouchs actions and his termination were handled in accordance with the Texas - based companys policies .

Crouch worked at the store for more than two years and is now married with a family and has no way to support them .
Hobbs said maybe the corporate policy should be revisited . "
My instincts tell me they are concerned more about people like Mr. White suing them for being stopped in the course of a theft than they are about rewarding or acknowledging in a positive manner that Mr. Crouch may have saved lives . "

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week , but the trend in jobless claims continued to point to tightening labor market conditions .
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ended June 30 , the Labor Department said on Thursday .
Claims data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported .
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 225,000 in the latest week .
Claims could become volatile in the coming weeks as automobile manufacturers close assembly lines for annual retooling .
More auto workers are likely to be affected by the temporary plant closures than in the past , which could throw off the model that the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations .
General Motors has announced it will close its Flint assembly plant for the whole of July .
The Labor Department said only claims for Maine were estimated last week .
The four - week moving average of initial claims , considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week - to - week volatility , rose 2,250 to 224,500 last week .
The labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment , with the jobless rate at an 18-year low of 3.8 percent .
The unemployment rate has dropped by three - tenths of a percentage point this year and is near the Federal Reserve 's forecast of 3.6 percent by the end of this year .
With a record 6.7 million unfilled jobs , layoffs are running very low .
The government is likely to report on Friday that employers added 195,000 jobs to their payrolls in June , on top of the 223,000 positions created in May , according to a Reuters survey of economists .
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 32,000 to 1.74 million in the week ended June 23 .
The four - week moving average of the so - called continuing claims fell 1,750 to 1.72 million , the lowest level since December 1973 .
Correction : U.S. weekly jobless claims totaled 231,000 , versus 225,000 expected .
A headline on an earlier version of this article misstated the expectation .
The numbers : The Empire State manufacturing index fell 2.4 points in July to a reading of 22.6 , the New York Federal Reserve said Monday .
Any reading of the diffusion index above zero indicates improving conditions .
Economists polled by Econoday expected a reading of 21 .
The June reading of 25 was an eight - month high .
What happened : The new - orders index dipped 3.1 points to 18.2 , while the shipments index fell 8.9 points to 14.6 .
Indexes for unfilled orders and inventories also declined .
The prices - paid index fell 10 points but was still elevated at 42.7 .
Optimism about the future slipped , with the index for future conditions falling 7.8 points to 31.1 .
The big picture : Economists believe the U.S. manufacturing sector is on an impressive roll but there is concern trade tensions could dampen growth .
There is no hard evidence that tariffs are hurting business investment yet .
Some economists had expected a clearer adverse reaction in the Empire report .
Economists use the Empire data to gauge the national ISM manufacturing index .
That index hit 60.2 in June , matching the second highest level in the expansion .
What are they saying : " Details softer than the headline , " said Ian Shepherdson , chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
He said the data appears to point to a drop in the July ISM .
The disappointment was mitigated in part by a strong showing in consumer spending in the second quarter .
Consumers looked stronger especially after upward revisions to May data .
Read : U.S. retail sales climb again in June after jumbo gain in May.
The numbers : The National Association of Home Builders monthly confidence index was unchanged at 68 in July .
What happened : The closely - watched tracker of builder sentiment matched the Econoday consensus forecast of a flat reading .
That s a level the industry group calls " healthy , " but its also the full - year average from 2017 , signalling little progress since then .
The numbers : U.S. production of goods such as new trucks , planes , drilling rigs and consumer electronics rebounded in June as the economy hit overdrive in the spring .
Industrial production rose 0.6 % in June to more than offset a similarly sized decline in May , the Federal Reserve said Tuesday .
That was a tick above the MarketWatch forecast .
Production expanded by a robust 6 % annual pace in the second quarter and by 3.8 % over the past year , reflecting a big pickup in growth after a lackluster start to 2018 .
Many companies complain they ca nt find enough skilled workers or get ready access to cheap supplies .
If utilities and mining are excluded , production of goods by U.S. manufacturers rose by 0.8 % .
What happened : Auto makers stepped up production of cars and trucks by almost 8 % after a fire at a major parts supplier temporarily disrupted supply chains in May. The mining industry raised output by 1.2 % in another strong showing for one of the fastest - growing sectors of the economy .
Higher oil and natural - gas prices are enticing drillers to extract more fossil fuels .
Yet output at utilities declined sharply for the second month in a row as the change in seasons led to lower use of residential power .
The government also revised utility output in May to show a decline instead of a small gain .
As a result , overall industrial production dropped 0.5 % in May instead of previously reported 0.1 % .
A measure known as capacity utilization that tracks whether factories are running at full tilt edged up to 78 % from 77.7 % .
While that s about 1.8 percentage points below the historic average , the rate of utilization is still at a multi - year high .
Big picture : Both businesses and consumers stepped up big time in the second quarter .
The economy likely grew at a heady 4 % annual pace or even faster .
The road ahead looks good for the time being .
Hiring is strong , job openings are at a record high and the unemployment rate is at a nearly two - decade low .
The danger lies further ahead : Worsening trade tensions could eventually slam the economy if the U.S. and key partners do nt come up with a compromise .

The Perry Ellis Spring 2009 fashion show is presented at The Promenade in Bryant Park in New York .
Men 's accessories company Randa Accessories is preparing a $ 28-a - share competing bid for Perry Ellis slightly higher than one from the apparel brand firm 's founder George Feldenkreis , the Wall Street Journal said on Sunday .
Feldenkreis has a proposed $ 27.50-a - share buyout of Perry Ellis to take it private .
He and his son Oscar , the chief executive officer , are the company 's two biggest investors , according to the newspaper .
Randa has obtained committed financing from large banks and other financiers for its bid and plans to use cash to fund the deal , said the Wall Street Journal on its website , citing the people familiar with the matter .
Feldenkreis ' offer values Perry Ellis at about $ 437 million , while Randa 's bid would put it at about $ 444 million , the paper said .
The Pew Research Center asked Americans who they thought did the best job as president in their lifetime .
The top pick : former President Barack Obama .
Obama was the choice of 44 percent of the respondents in the poll , which was published Wednesday .
Bill Clinton came in second with 33 percent and Ronald Reagan was third with 32 percent .
Although not yet even halfway through his first term , President Donald Trump got 19 percent to place him in fourth place , ahead of both Bushes , John F. Kennedy and Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
According to Pew , Obama got 20 percent at about the same point in his presidency .
The survey was conducted from June 5 - 12 and 2,002 people were asked to give both their first and second choices .
It has an error margin of 2.6 points .
More : Why Donald Trump and Barack Obama are about to lose a lot of Twitter followers More : Obama and Biden ride again ( as detectives ! )
in the fun mystery , ' Hope Never Dies ' Obviously , when someone lived is key to who they think was the best president of their lifetime .
For example , of those who were alive during the Kennedy administration , about a quarter chose JFK .
Millennials ( born 1981 to 1996 ) were the most likely to choose Obama , with 62 percent naming him as their first or second choice .
Reagan was the top pick for Generation X ( 1965 to 1980 ) , baby boomers ( 1946 to 1964 ) and the silent generation ( 1928 to 1945 ) .
Unsurprisingly , party identification was very closely tied to a person 's answer .
Obama was the first or second pick of 71 percent of Democrats but only 13 percent of Republicans .
Reagan was the clear favorite among Republicans with 57 percent ( 12 percent among Democrats ) .
Trump was the second pick for Republicans at 40 percent .
Only 3 percent of Democrats named Trump .

The promise of concierge medical practices is to provide round - the - clock access to doctors when patients need it .
For New York start - up Priority Private Care , that means going to where their members are this summer -- the Hamptons . "
We have an emergency physician out there during the summer ( and ) we are providing house calls , " said Ben Kruger , PPC co - founder . "
We have also paired with a private ambulance company , and we have a portable x - ray ... so its more than your average house call . "
PPC also sends physicians to patients homes in New York City , but the 18-month old start - up focuses on providing on - demand urgent care services at its 24-hour facility in Manhattan for an annual membership fee that starts at $ 3,000 per person .
For members like Olympic skater Evan Lysacek , it has meant being able to get treatment with no waiting when he 's suffered a debilitating migraine in the middle of the night . "
Historically I would go to the ER , because I had nowhere else to go , " the gold medalist explained , " and waited hours and hours to be seen by a doctor ... and then spent days recuperating . "
When he had an attack last month , he was able to see a doctor at PPC 15 minutes after he called for an appointment . "
They saw me and gave me the attention that I needed , right away ... and within four hours I already starting to feel better , " the gold medalist said .
Beyond 24-hour staffing , PPCs private emergency room offers immediate access to a full suite of imaging machines , including a MRI machine and CT scanner . " [
Off - hours , ] the only places that have a CT scan in the city are the hospitals -- but the problem is that if you there in the middle of the night , you re going to wait , " said Kruger .
Hospital emergency rooms are required by law to take all patients who walk in the door , and to treat the most dire cases first .
The result is that patients with non life - threatening issues can wait hours for care .
It was Krugers fathers who came up with the idea of creating an emergency concierge service for patients willing to pay for better access .
Dr. Bernard Kruger already had a primary care concierge practice , but he had no place to send his patients when they needed care in the middle of the night .
The younger Kruger teamed with his father and former health - care analyst Andrew Olanow to launch the service nearly two years ago .
To make it financially viable , they avoided trying to build out their own ER . "
The radiology industry has been under severe pressure so there are radiology centers that are basically available to be taken over , " said Olanow . "
We found a radiology center that had all of the imaging that we wanted , were able to partner into it and that 's enabled us to get access to that equipment without have to put a severe amount of capex . "
PPC says it now has 1,300 members who pay up to $ 5,000 per person for 24/7 access to its doctors and imaging as well as coordinated access to a network of specialists and area hospitals .
That fee comes on top of health insurance .
PPC also helps coordinate billing for its members , and imaging services done at PPC overnight are generally billed out - of - network .
For Evan Lysacek the math works .
He says his past ER bills often ran into thousands of dollars . "
The membership is a few thousand .
So , it covers one ER visit , without the four - hour wait , " he said .
PPC executives say they are planning to expand their service in New York over the next year , with a second office in Manhattan and a facility in the Hamptons .
They hope to launch in other major cities in the next two years , which will allow them to offer members something close to a national network of VIP emergency care .

The removal of General Electric from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 111 years says more about stock market indices than it does about GE .
Traders work on the main trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange as the Dow Jones industrial average passes the 20,000 mark shortly after the opening of the trading session on Jan. 25 , 2017 .
Brendan McDermid | Reuters In the statement announcing the addition of Walgreens Boots Alliance , David Blitzer , managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices , said that " consumer , finance , health care and technology companies are more prominent today , and the relative importance of industrial companies is less . ....
Todays change to the DJIA will make the index a better measure of the economy and the stock market . "
As the CNBC IQ100 , powered by M*CAM , has clearly demonstrated , the DJIA continues to struggle to find relevance in the face of macroeconomic conditions and altered market dynamics .
The price - weighted nature of the DJIA makes it increasingly susceptible to factors that have more to do with market activities of individual corporations than broader market conditions .
While the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices may have chosen Walgreens for its price and sector representation , it may have overlooked a critical aspect of the mandate to measure the economy .
Two days after Walgreens was added to Dow , Amazon entered pharmacy business Walgreens Boots Alliance is not a market innovator .
As a consumer retail outlet primarily for the pharmaceutical industry , the firms intellectual property holdings are negligible .
Where industry leaders have been focused on drug - interaction detection , drug counterfeiting , customizable dosing and the like , Walgreens is dependent on the technology of others .
The majority of Walgreens pending patents are subtle variations on data , inventory and prescription management business methods , which offer little to no market differentiation .
Virtually all of the Boots Company PLC legacy patents on store - brand cosmetics or pill packaging are expired or soon to expire .
In its 2017 annual report , the company states that approximately 98 percent of its prescription sales came from managed care and governmental reimbursement programs .
In other words , the majority of Walgreens Boots ' business is more a proxy for managed health care than it is a reflection of consumer products .
The selection of Walgreens for inclusion into the DJIA continues to challenge the relevance of an index branded as an " industrial average . "
As index - linked investment activity continues to expand through the proliferation of exchange - traded funds and other indexing products , the increasing homogeneity of the Dow , the and the Russell methodologies converge on consensus insights rather than on meaningful market insights .
The Sainsbury 's logo stands above the entrance to the J Sainsbury Plc flagship store in London , U.K. Sainsbury 's , Britain 's second biggest supermarket group which agreed a 7.3 billion pound ( $ 9.7 billion ) takeover of rival Asda in April , saw sales growth slow in its latest quarter , reflecting price cuts in a competitive market .
The firm said on Wednesday retail like - for - like sales , excluding fuel , rose 0.2 percent in the 16 weeks to June 30 , its fiscal first quarter .
That was ahead of analysts ' average forecast for a fall of 0.1 percent but below growth of 0.9 percent in the previous quarter . "
The headline numbers reflect the level of price reductions we have made in key areas like fresh meat , fruit and vegetables since March , " said Chief Executive Mike Coupe . "
Our price position has improved and customers have responded well , resulting in a continuation of the improved volume trend we saw in the second half of last financial year . "
Total retail sales rose 0.8 percent , excluding fuel .
According to the most recent industry data and company updates Sainsbury 's has seen the weakest trading among Britain 's big four grocers , which also includes market leader Tesco and No .
4 Morrisons .
Shares in Sainsbury 's have risen 32 percent so far this year on the back of deal to buy Walmart owned Asda , which is currently being probed by Britain 's regulator , the Competition and Markets Authority ( CMA ) .
The deal would see the combined group overtake Tesco as Britain 's biggest grocer .
The CMA 's probe is expected to be lengthy and Sainsbury 's does not anticipate the deal being concluded until he second half of 2019 .
Sainsbury 's said on Wednesday it has agreed a financing package of 3.5 billion pounds for the deal . "
The market remains competitive .
However , we have the right strategy in place and our proposal to combine Sainsbury 's and Asda will create a dynamic new player in UK retail , " said Coupe .
The second quarter of 2018 was the best quarter for personal - computer shipments in more than six years , IDC reported Thursday afternoon , confirming an earlier report from rival Gartner .
IDC tracked 2.7 % growth in PC shipments from the same quarter a year ago , blowing away its projection of 0.3 % for the biggest gains since the first quarter of 2012 , when the market expanded by 4.2 % .
Earlier Thursday , Gartner reported the first year - on - year gain since the same quarter , but IDC has tracked gains in the sector in previous quarters while looking at a slightly larger collection of form factors that includes Chromebooks .
The one big difference between the two quarterly studies was at the top of the market - share rankings , where HP Inc. HPQ , +3.34 % came in slightly behind Lenovo Group Ltd. 992 , -2.59 % in Gartner 's market - share rankings but was easily on top of IDC 's .
According to IDC , HP had 23.9 % of the market in the second quarter while Lenovo had 22.1 % , though Lenovo grew at a faster rate ( 11.3 % ) than HP ( 7.6 % ) .
Trailing those two leaders were Dell Technologies Inc. , Apple Inc. AAPL , -0.32 % and Acer Group .
Those five manufacturers all increased shipments year - over - year , IDC said , while PC shipments from other companies declined 7.3 % .
Both analysis firms said that a continuing business refresh of PCs with Microsoft Corp. 's MSFT , -0.15 % Windows 10 operating system was the most important driver of the current gains for PC shipments .
The second - quarter earnings season kicked off Friday as expected with big banks JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. beating expectations and Wells Fargo falling short , but all three stocks fizzled in early trade as the numbers failed to inspire investors .
Wells Fargo shares WFC , -1.19 % were down 2.2 % in midday trade , while Citi C , -1.85 % was down 2.7 % .
JPMorgan JPM , -0.59 % was down 0.2 % , while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % rose 0.2 % and the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % was flat .
Analysts were expecting the numbers to be strong and for economic growth to support lending and volatile markets to support trading .
But most correctly predicted that they were unlikely to reverse the weakness in bank stocks that has persisted since February . "
Earnings were mixed , " said JP Gravitt , chief executive of independent market news and research company Market Realist . "
When you look at the different components , you can see that not everything is working .
You have the yield curve inverting , banks ca nt get net interest margins to grow , investment banking is not booming , and the loan business looks OK at JPMorgan , but not at Wells Fargo .
Citi was somewhere in between . "
The backdrop of trade tensions with China and other major partners surfaced on earnings calls , but was shrugged off as " too early to matter . "

Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said it is weighing on overall market , but not on his bank . "
Its certainly had some impact in the overall feeling in the market , its created some uncertainty , so I do think its probably had some impact on people making decisions , " Gerspach told reporters on a call . "
But from an overall business point of view we have nt seen that impact as of yet . "
Gravitt from Market Realist said the trade issues are probably giving the banks big corporate clients whiplash . "
if you re a company and you want to put a plant in China or Mexico right now , you are not making that decision , so there is a pretty big economic outcome for some companies . "
See : As the trade war heats up , Goldman says take cover in these stocks Dimon also played down worries about the flattening yield curve , as short - term rates rise with the Federal Reserves well - telegraphed interest rate increases , while the long - end of the curve falls , typically viewed as a precursor to an economic downturn or recession . "
You re looking for potholes , there are not a lot of things out there , " he said in response to a question on the banks earnings call .
JPMorgan reported net profit of $ 8.3 billion , or $ 2.29 a share , ahead of the FactSet consensus of $ 2.22 a share .
Loans rose 4 % to $ 935.16 billion and net interest income rose 9 % to $ 13.6 billion .
Trading revenue rose 13 % to $ 5.4 billion as fixed income revenue rose 7 % and equity markets revenue rose 24 % to $ 1.96 billion .
Citigroup reported net profit of $ 4.49 billion , or $ 1.63 a share , up from $ 3.87 billion , or $ 1.56 a share , in the year - earlier period .
Revenue rose 2 % to $ 18.5 billion .
The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $ 1.56 and revenue of $ 18.5 billion .
Loans rose 4 % .
Trading revenue was down 1 % to $ 3.9 billion as fixed - income trading fell 6 % , while equities trading was up 19 % .
What the U.S.-China Trade War Means for Workers on the Ground Wells Fargo said net income fell 12 % to $ 4.79 billion , or 98 cents a share , below the FactSet consensus of $ 1.12 a share , while total revenue slipped 2 % to $ 21.55 billion , missing expectations of $ 12.68 billion .
Investors are now looking ahead to next weeks slate , which will start Monday with earnings from tech highflier Netflix Inc. NFLX , -3.76 % .
If Netflix were to miss on subscriber additions , that would be a " big problem , " said Gravitt , that could trigger a big selloff of tech stocks , which have been leading the stock market all year with repeated record highs .

The social network 's shares soared to an all - time intraday high of $ 203.64 a share , before closing at a new record just below that price .
That translated Facebook 's market value to nearly $ 590 billion .
Facebook 's stock closed at a record on Friday , gaining nearly 5 percent as the company shook off the effects of a privacy scandal that engulfed it earlier this year .
Fridays gains mark a complete recovery from March , when Facebook shares hit a 52-week intraday low of $ 149.02 per share , following reports the company mishandled data from about 87 million users .
Facebook 's data woes are far from over , although investors no longer seem concerned .
On Monday , the social media company confirmed that the FBI , SEC , and FTC have all joined the Justice Department in asking questions about user data being improperly shared with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica .
Facebook shares dipped after the reports , but made a strong comeback later in the week .
The stock has gained about 15 percent so far in 2018 .

Blinded by a bull in one eye in late 2011 after badly losing his footing in a bullring , the matador made a stunning comeback to the arena about six months later , much to the utter shock of fans .
Similarly , Wall Street investors find themselves facing off with a bull of their own , one that is in its ninth year and , despite being beset by a cavalcade of concerns , appears on the verge of resuming the second - longest run since WWII .
That is perhaps much to the consternation of bears and the confusion of nervous optimist alike .
On Friday , the 13th no less , the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % finished above 2,800 for the first time since Feb. 1 , piercing a psychological , round - number level that had proven a source of key resistance for the market since it stumbled badly into correction territory on Feb. 8 .
Indeed , the S&P 500 finished Fridays session 0.1 % higher at 2,801.31 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % closed up 0.4 % at 25,019.41 , while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP , -1.83 % mustered sufficient momentum to eke out back - to - back finishes at an all - time closing high at 7,825.98 , up less than 0.1 % .
The S&P 500 sits just 2.5 % from its Jan. 26 , record , while the Dow stands 6 % short of its closing peak from earlier in the year .
The recent uptrend has come in fits and starts , but come it has , amid the aforementioned headwinds .
Those factors include : " The market has been able to grind higher and its been able to do so even with these headwinds , " Michael Arone , chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors told MarketWatch in an interview .
The State Street strategist views trade conflagration as a concern that may have fallen to the wayside even if it continues to be a situation that unspools over weeks and months . "
The trade discussion has been a bit longer than folks had been anticipating and it might be longer still -- and a bit messier , " Arone said .
Check out : Trade - war tracker : Here are the new levies , imposed and threatened He added : " This week there seems to be a changing sentiment that much of the trade threat in terms of the escalation of the tariffs is being used as a tool to bring the sides together . "
In the end , sentiment may be improving as reflected by the stock markets recent action ; but there are many who have cautioned against being too complacent .
Scott Minerd of Guggenheim and Ray Dalio , the founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates , appear to be warning that escalating trade disputes could still be a major problem for the market .

Just a few days ago , the flamboyant picador suffered an even more horrific injury at the horns of another bull after once again losing his footing .
This episode came about a year after being gored back in March 2017 .
Observers can say what they will about bullfighting , or investing for that matter , but the lesson here may be that over long periods , the bull eventually wins .
Second - quarter earnings Second - quarter earnings unofficially kicked off on Friday , but banks were nt precisely the catalyst for the market move higher , with the financial sector , as measured by the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF , -1.11 % , finishing down by 0.4 % even as JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM , -0.59 % beat analysts estimates .
Still , analysts are estimating 20 % earnings - per - share growth , up from 18.9 % at start of the quarter , according to FactSet data .
That is down from the first - quarters nearly 25 % EPS growth .
Powell testimony Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to deliver his semiannual monetary policy report to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and is likely to testify in front of the House Financial Services Committee thereafter ( though that has nt been confirmed ) .
The testimony comes a little over a month after the Fed raised interest rates on June 13 for the seventh time since the end of 2015 .
Powells comments are likely to add more dimension and texture to the institutions monetary - policy strategy , as it looks to bring interest rates to a more normal , precrisis level and delever its asset portfolio , which became bloated to the tune of some $ 4.5 trillion during the height of the 2007 - 09 asset - backed fueled blowup .

The sunny outlook for the global economy seen this spring has gotten a lot darker , the International Monetary Fund said Monday .
Growth is slowing in the euro area , Japan and the United Kingdom , the IMF said , in an update of its world economic outlook .
The IMF continued to project global growth rates of 3.9 % for this year and 2019 , but said this strong growth is " less even , more fragile [ and ] under threat . "
The Trump administration will cut at least $ 26 million in funding from a key Affordable Care Act outreach program that helps people sign up for health insurance , federal health officials said Tuesday .
The federal agency that oversees the " navigator " program said that up to $ 10 million will be available for outreach organizations in 34 states that use the federal marketplace .
Each state will receive a minimum of $ 100,000 for eligible groups that help people sign up for health insurance .
In announcing a more than 70 percent funding cut from a year ago , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said in a notice that the marketplace navigator groups should be able to " stretch their funding further " with less demand for in - person assistance because the marketplace is more familiar to most Americans .
Last year , the Trump administration cut more than 40 percent from the navigator program , which funds non - profits and grassroots groups that help people sign up for health insurance .
Navigator groups that have helped people sign up for health insurance since Obamacare coverage began in 2014 said the funding cuts will be difficult to absorb . "
I am almost speechless , to be honest with you , " said Jodi Ray , director of Florida Covering Kids & Families , a navigator group at the University of South Florida .
Ray 's group received $ 4.9 million last year to fund more than 130 navigators across Florida to reach the state 's vulnerable residents .
The Florida group will need to make difficult choices about who they serve during open enrollment period that begins in November . "
Do we look at what 's easiest to get most numbers ( of signups ) , or do we concentrate on those who are the most time - consuming to assist ? "
Ray said . "
Were talking about putting one population against another . "
In announcing the funding cuts , CMS said in a news release that navigators " failed to enroll a meaningful amount of people " on the federal marketplace and " not nearly enough to justify the millions of federal dollars spent on the program . "
Navigator groups located in federal exchange states have grown anxious in recent weeks because their federal funding ends in September and they did not know how much money will be available beyond then .
In past years , CMS announced funding opportunities in April and required navigator groups to apply for grants by mid - June .
That gave the federal agency 's staff enough time to review applications and award grants before open enrollment begins .
Since efforts in Congress to repeal Obama 's signature health care law failed , the Trump administration to pursue administrative changes to chip away at the 2010 law .
A Labor Department rule unveiled last month allows small businesses and self - employed individuals to band together and buy potentially less - expensive " association " plans that do n't carry all the benefits required by the health law .
The Trump administration also is seeking to expand the use of short - term health insurance plans that are often less expensive but do n't have the same consumer protections as exchange plans .
Earlier this week , the administration said it would half funding to a " risk adustment " program that reimburse health insurers that covered individual with more expensive medical conditions .
In June , the Justice Department said it will no longer defend the health law in a federal court case filed by 20 states , potentially jeopardizing a provision that protects consumers from being denied coverage based on existing medical conditions .
The U.S. dollar gained momentum higher versus most of its rivals on Tuesday , as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell maintained an upbeat outlook for the U.S. economy even in light of the continuing trade spats surrounding the Trump administration .

The upbeat tone of Fed Chair Jerome Powells semiannual testimony to Congress suggests that uncertainty over trade policy will not prevent the fed from continuing to raise interest rates , " wrote Andrew Hunter , U.S. economist at Capital Economics .
The ICE U.S. dollar index DXY , -0.02 % , which measures the buck against a basket of six other currencies , most prominently the euro , was last up 0.5 % at 94.961 , having inched up from its previous gains after Powells testimony concluded .

Do nt miss : Why the market is nt punishing the dollar amid trade - war worries On the flattening of the Treasury yield curve -- which measures the yields of U.S. government bonds with different maturities -- Powell said it was a much discussed topic among central bank officials and that he considered the curve as a gauge for where neutral interest rates should be .
Even with interest rates long priced into the market , the dollars sluggishness of late could open the door to more weakness , most noticeably against the Japanese yen USDJPY , +0.19 % , said Hans Redeker and the currency strategy team at Morgan Stanley , in a note .
The greenback last bought Y=112.86 , compared with Y=112.28 late Monday , hitting a fresh year - to - date high versus the Japanese currency .

A bear steepener is the condition in which rates of long - term bonds rise at a faster clip than their short - term counterparts .
Meanwhile , the European Union signed a free trade deal with Japan on Tuesday , which propelled the euro to its highest level since early May versus the yen EURJPY , +0.22 % .
The eurozone currency last fetched Y=131.62 , off its session high of Y=131.99 .
Elsewhere in Europe , the deck was stacked against the British pound GBPUSD , +0.10 % once again .
U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May , who has been criticized inside and outside her party for months for her approach to Brexit , narrowly won a vote to keep Britain in the EUs customs union following its exit from the tea bloc .
The British pound slumped to a session low of $ 1.3071 following the vote but recovered some to $ 1.3113 .
The euro EURGBP , -0.08 % rose 0.5 % to PS0.8890 against the pound , close to the four - month high it hit earlier this month .
If it had nt been for Mays win on Tuesday -- by a mere six votes more -- the PM could have faced a vote of no confidence leading the country to fresh elections . "
We believe the risk of Parliament rejecting any deal put in front of them late in 2018 , or early in 2019 , is increasing , and this puts both the agreement on future relationships and the transition period after the end of March 2019 in serious jeopardy , " said John Wraith , a strategist at UBS , in a note ahead of Tuesdays customs union vote .

The U.S. dollar was trading higher against major rivals on Wednesday , a bullish reflection of upbeat economic outlooks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the central banks Beige Book report .
Powell reiterated the likelihood for gradual interest - rate tightening , suggesting the Fed was on track to raise rates twice more before the end of 2018 .
Meanwhile , the central banks periodic review of the economy known as the Beige Book was notably more optimistic than just a few months ago .
The U.S. stock markets bulls and bears have for months been an arm - wrestling match with no end in sight .
However , whichever side " wins " could dictate the tone on Wall Street for months .
For all the back and forth seen on Wall Street thus far this year , there has been one primary story that explains most of 2018s trading activity .
There are a number of negatives in the market -- among them the specter of a trade war , less accommodative central banks , and the fact that gains have come on the back of a few big stocks , as opposed to being broad - based -- that have put a ceiling on prices .
This ceiling is represented by the record highs the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , -1.34 % and the S&P 500 index SPX , -1.18 % hit in late January .
At the same time , there are numerous positives in the market , including strong economic data , earnings growth , and the growing impact of 2017s tax bill .
These have served to put a floor under equity prices , the 2018 low that was put in shortly after the most recent record .
The result of this is a market that has been stubbornly rangebound since February , with both the Dow and the S&P unable to break out of this roughly 10%-wide spread of prices .
Both have been in a correction , defined as a 10 % drop without a full recovery from that low , since February , their longest stretch since the financial crisis .
In a sign of how uncertain investors are about the current environment , the AAII Sentiment Survey shows that 32.9 % of investors describe themselves as neutral on the market , meaning they expect prices will remain roughly the same over the coming six months .
This is above the long - term average of 31 % ; neutral sentiment has been above the historical average for 20 straight weeks .
Read : No longer just ' noise : ongoing trade uncertainty saps investor confidence Eventually , however , either the bull case or the bear case will dominate , and indexes will move out of their range .
Whichever side " wins " remains to be seen , but analysts say that the first side of the range to be breached could set the tone going forward .
In other words , if stocks put in a new high for the year , expect more records to follow .
If they put in a new low , do nt be surprised if the selling accelerates . "
The market has been balancing the positive and negative sides of the equation , but either side could easily overwhelm the other , " said David Carter , who oversees about $ 2 billion in assets as the chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors . "
If the issue of a trade war goes away , our fundamentals are strong enough to support our going to new highs and beyond .
But if the trade skirmish escalates into a full - blown trade war , that will swamp the fundamentals and equity markets will really suffer .
Not only would we put in new lows , but its really unclear how far we could fall . "
According to UBS , the S&P 500 could fall 11 % if trade tensions escalate , which would put in a new low for the year .
If the issue becomes a full trade war , the S&P could drop 21 % , enough to put it in bear - market territory .
Courtesy UBS At current levels , the Dow is 6.6 % below its record , and 5.8 % above its closing low of the year .
The S&P is 2.9 % beneath its record and 8.2 % above its closing low .
Recent action has trended higher , with stocks on track for their fifth rise of the past six sessions on Thursday .
Equities have also been improving on the basis of technical analysis .
According to StockCharts , 61.8 % of S&P 500 components are above their 200-day moving average , a closely watch level for long - term momentum trends .
While this is below the 80 % rate hit in late January , as well as the 67.67 % average over the past 200 days , it is up from the roughly 55 % rate in late June .
Just 61 % of S&P stocks are below their 50-day , used as a proxy for shorter - term momentum trends .
This is almost the exact average ratio over both the past 50 trading days and the past 200 days .
Despite recent gains , volatility has remained high , and investors have been quick to sell on any negative headlines .
Investors have been trimming their exposure to equities , and stock - based funds recently saw their second - largest weekly outflows ever , while exchange - traded funds had their third month of negative flows thus far in 2018 in June . "
The fact that we ve been rangebound makes sense .
The markets general momentum and sentiment are still positive , and we ve yet to see the full effects of the tax - cut legislation .
However , if we have nt seen the impact of that show up , we certainly have nt seen the impact of what the trade issue could mean if it escalates , " said Steve Sosnick , chief options strategist at Interactive Brokers Group .
Sosnick said he was nt just looking to see whether the market would break out of its range to determine the narrative over the subsequent months , but why it does . "
The fact that the S&P hits a certain number would nt change the outlook .
A slow grind higher or lower would nt mean that a material change in the environment .
Its the how and the why that changes the narrative . "

The yield curve has captured Wall Street -- and to a lesser extent Main Streets -- attention in recent weeks .
And for a good reason .
The past nine recessions have been preceded by the inversion of the curve , where short - term Treasury rates exceed their long - term counterparts .
Much of the breathless attention on the shape of the curve has centered on the tightening gap between the 2-year TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.583 % and 10-year Treasury yields TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.435 % .
But there are other key pairs that can signal how investors are thinking about where the economy is headed from here .
3-month bill and 10-year note While 2s - versus-10s garners the most attention , many economists and Fed officials tend to focus more acutely on the gap between the 3-month bill and the 10-year note as the best signal , if it inverts , of an impending recession .
This relationship , which grasps the more dramatic difference between very near - term rates and a reasonable point of time in the uncertain future , has a better record , these researchers say .
The probability of a recession over 12 months gradually climbed to 40 % in 2008 from less than 10 % when the 3-month-10-year spread inverted substantially in June 2006 , according to data from the New York Federal Reserve .
5-year note and 30-year bond The gap between these Treasury pairs tends to be viewed as a good read of inflation expectations and economic strength .
A weaker economy and flagging inflation expectations , which chip away at a bonds fixed value , can result in a tighter yield spread , said Jim Smiegel , chief investment officer of absolute return strategies for SEI Investments .
7-year and 10-year notes A canary in the coal mine , an inversion between the 7-year TMUBMUSD07Y , 1.366 % and the 10-year notes implies that other parts of the curve may soon invert , according to Ian Lyngen of BMO Capital Markets .
He found that when the yield gap between the two maturities fell below zero in 1988 , other pairs also soon inverted .
10-year note and 30-year bond The gap between the 10-year note and the 30-year bond is nt widely watched by professionals but it is another fault line in the yield - curve dynamic that could presage ill for the market DJIA , -1.34 % SPX , -1.18 % , as it has reached its tightest since 2007 .
2-year and 10-year notes This remains the most popular way to assess the yield curves slope on Wall Street .
Because investors normally demand a higher return for borrowing long term than on a shorter - term basis , the slope is positive ( upward sloping left to right ) during an expansion , with long - term interest rates typically running a couple percentage points above short - term rates .
That means an inverted curve in the 2s and 10s tends to reflect a dimming outlook for the economy .
Its tightening trend has been hastened by a Federal Reserve bent on raising short - term rates .

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was slightly higher at 2.842 percent at 2:58 p.m. ET , while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down at 2.952 percent .
Bond yields move inversely to prices .
Fixed income investors were also on edge ahead of the Department of Labor 's monthly update on the employment situation , due out on Friday .
U.S. government debt yields were little changed on Thursday after the Federal Reserve 's latest minutes showed that officials are worried about letting the economy run too hot .
The Federal Open Market Committee published the minutes from its latest meeting Thursday , with some members expressing concern " that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn . "
Nearly all officials felt comfortable continuing to raise interest rates on a regular basis in response to those qualms , even amid growing trade tensions and a flattening yield curve . "
The plan is on : Gradual increases in rates is still what s on the table , " said Putri Pascualy , managing director and credit strategist at PAAMCO . "
There s a lot of talk about the improvement in the economic story and strength in the labor market .
But the third pillar , inflation ... despite the strength in the labor market and economy , inflation is just right about where they want it to be . "
At their last meeting , the Fed decided to increase its benchmark short - term interest rate by a quarter percentage point .
In addition , the central bank signaled that two more rate hikes were expected to occur by year - end .
The central bank did , however , note possible negative repercussions from the growing trade dispute between the U.S. and its economic allies -- specifically any widespread reduction in business investment as a result of uncertainty . "
The risk of trade policy and specifically tariffs has been identified as the one key factor that could derail the economic engine , " Pascualy added . "
The Fed seems less concerned about the economic impact of the tariffs themselves .
What is potentially important is the impact on confidence - it could change peoples ' or businesses plans on investment . "
Wall Street will likely be watching for any foreign response when the U.S. slaps $ 34 billion worth of tariffs on China on Friday ; Beijing is expected to implement the same amount in counter - duties .
Jobs in the U.S. rose by 177,000 in June , ADP and Moody 's Analytics reported Thursday , while economists polled by Thomson Reuters expected a gain of 190,000 .
June marked the fourth straight month of jobs growth below 200,000 .
Jobs growth for the previous month , however , was revised up by 11,000 to 189,000 , mitigating the impact .
Meanwhile , the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week , though overall trends continued to suggest a tight labor market .
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 231,000 for the week ended June 30 , the Labor Department said on Thursday .
Their research identified four distinct personality types in every office .
By recognizing the key differences in how people work and then flexing your own working style accordingly , you can improve your performance on the job .
So says a new book called " Business Chemistry : Practical Magic for Crafting Powerful Work Relationships " by Suzanne Vickberg and Kim Christfort .
It also plays a large role in your relationships at work and how you fare in the job itself , including your engagement in projects and meetings and your career success overall .
According to Vickberg , who is also a psychologist , the more you know about your co - workers and managers personality types , as well as your own , the better off you ll be . "
Its flexing the way you do things so you can work better , and strengthening the relationships [ at work ] , to get more of what you want out of it , " Vickberg said .
Here are the four primary types : Pioneers spark energy and imagination .
They re outgoing , spontaneous and adaptable .
They re creative thinkers who believe big risks can bring great things .

For example , a detail - oriented guardian may tend to write long , thorough emails .
But if you are writing to a driver , who is more focused , then keep it short and only include key points to improve your communication , Vickberg said . "
The more you can understand different peoples styles , the more engaged people will be and efficient at getting work done . "
To understand your own style -- and your office mates -- there is a test which you can take here .
There are some generalizations as well : Women are more likely to be integrators and men are more likely to be drivers .
Baby boomers tend to be pioneers or integrators -- and CEOs are most likely to be either pioneers or drivers .
More from Personal Finance : Of course , better understanding other peoples personality types can be beneficial outside the workplace as well , Vickberg added .

There are a lot of labels that can be associated with Beth Ditto : Singer .
Fashion designer .
Self - described " fat , feminist lesbian from Arkansas . " "
Too left " to be considered a Democrat .
Huge fan of " The Office . "
But despite the fact that she s about to make her big - screen debut , there 's one label she would n't necessarily associate with herself . "
I would nt say I m an actor , but it was so fun , " says Ditto , 37 , of her time on the set of Gus Van Sant 's " Do nt Worry , He Wo nt Get Far on Foot " ( in theaters Friday ) , shooting with actors Joaquin Phoenix , Jonah Hill and Kim Gordon . (
Jack Black and Rooney Mara also star . )
An adaptation of cartoonist John Callahan 's memoir , the movie follows a man 's recovery and struggle with addiction after an accident leaves him a quadriplegic .
Ditto says she was drawn to the story for its portrayal of someone who was " really multifaceted and really complex . "
More : How Joaquin Phoenix played a quadriplegic cartoonist in ' He Wo n't Get Far ' Related:10 movies you must see this summer , from ' Avengers ' to young Han Solo " A lot of the time when you see somebody who s overcoming major obstacles ... there s a lot of hero worship in it .
It 's a lot of even painting the picture of this perfect person . ...
That 's what 's cool about this : The truth is just the truth . "
Ditto 's character , Reba , is a fellow Alcoholics Anonymous group member who helps Callahan ( Phoenix ) gain some perspective on recovery .
In the book , she inhabits less than a full page , but here , she 's one of the more outspoken members of the support group , which accounts for a good portion of the film .
And , yes , her character 's accent is real : Ditto is n't sure if he was kidding , but Phoenix wondered why she was still using her " fake " Southern drawl after their first scene ended .
She does n't have plans for future acting roles , though she says she 's open to the idea .
For now , she 's on tour in Europe : Ditto released her solo album last summer after breaking up with the Portland - based rock group Gossip in 2016 .
For the film , she was able to channel the " butch , Southern , rural , farm woman " type she grew up surrounded by , but that 's about where the similarities between her and the character end .
Reba is sweet and simple ; Ditto is outspoken with a bold fashion sense .
Her style boasts loud personalities , as do her fashion idols : Miss Piggy ( yep , Kermit the Frog 's on - again , off - again girlfriend ) , British icon Twiggy and Hungry , a Berlin - based drag performer known for wildly over - the - top , distorted makeup .
She 's been on the runway for Jean Paul Gaultier and Marc Jacobs , and has created two plus - size clothing lines . "
I just wanted to give people options , " she says . "
There s this big gap that s missing ( in plus - size fashion ) : You either have high - street or you have really , really expensive .
A lot of people I know who are my size can afford to get things tailored , but not everybody can afford to do that . "
Growing up in the " religious South , " Ditto said she was exposed to anti - LGBTQ rhetoric that had a lasting negative effect on her mental health , though her own family was predominantly supportive . "
If my upbringing had been easier and more accepting , had I not had to go through trauma just to be who I actually am , I do nt think that I would be in this particular spot with mental health , " she says . "
I take ( antidepressants ) every day and its my saving grace .
I ve been on medication since my teens and its what helps me get through . "
Another label Ditto does n't mind : social justice warrior . ( "
People are like , ' Ugh , a SJW , ' and I 'm like , ' Yeah , why is that bad ? ' ")
Her Twitter account promotes political issues far more than it does any of her own projects .
And she ca n't stand people who tell celebrities to stay in their own lanes . "
I would rather hang out with a celebrity who talks about caring for the world , " Ditto says . "
I want to hear what people have to say .
We live in a celebrity culture where it 's very obviously looked up to and followed to a T : the way people look , the way people talk , the way people act . "
That is the culture we live in , and if that 's what it takes to instill some sort of empathy and right - doing for the good of everybody , then I think that 's the most awesome thing you can do . "

There has been a lot of talk in the world of exchange - traded funds that giants like Vanguard Group , BlackRock 's iShares and Charles Schwab are headed in the direction of trading without any management fee at all .
We 're not there yet , but Vanguard Group is making a major move related to ETF fees that no other firm has yet made .
Starting in August , investors using Vanguard 's online brokerage platform will be able to trade all ETFs on a commission - free basis , including ETFs from rivals iShares , Schwab and State Street Global Advisors .
Rosenbluth said the idea that Vanguard brokerage investors will be able to trade SSGA 's SPDR S&P 500 ( SPY ) and iShares iBoxx High Yield ( HYG ) commission - free is not something CFRA expects other brokerage firms to follow , because it would require them to forgo their existing exclusive relationships . "
This is a significant move by Vanguard , " said Todd Rosenbluth , director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA . "
Other brokerage firms , such as Schwab or TD Ameritrade , provide commission - free trades on a subset of ETFs , with the asset managers supplementing the cost savings . "
Yet there is one big exception : Vanguard will not offer commission - free access to leveraged or inverse ETFs .
Vanguard said it was excluding the leveraged and inverse ETFS due to " their speculative nature runs counter to our investors focus on long - term success . "
Other brokerage platforms have signed exclusive deals with specific ETF providers to offer commission - free trades as competition has increased , such as Fidelity Investments ' tie - up with iShares , but no online platform has gone near this Vanguard move , which includes access to more than 100 ETF providers and roughly 1,800 ETFs of the roughly 2,000 in the market .
Investors who use the online Vanguard platform can already buy an ETF for free and have been able to do that for a decade , though there are some restrictions to curb frequent trading for brokerage clients with less than $ 1 million in assets .
But that frequent trading policy will eliminated at the same time the commission - free changes go into effect in August .
There will be no limitations on trading of any ETFs -- Vanguard or non - Vanguard . "
The ETF price war has been escalating and spreading to all corners .
This is the latest salvo by Vanguard , one of the low - cost leaders in the ETF space , aimed at attracting new clients and then offering them other services , where they can make more money .
It is a big development in the ETF price war , " said Neena Mishra , director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research .
Mishra does believe competitors will make moves in response and soon .
But Vanguard also has an advantage in that it is an asset manager first and brokerage business second .
Its business model relies less on brokerage revenue than stickiness of fund assets . "
Vanguard is more an asset manager that offers a smaller platform for trades to occur , whereas other firms profit more from the assets on and the trades via a brokerage platform .
By moving to commission free for all , a brokerage firm forgoes some revenue in exchange for stickier assets , " Rosenbluth said .
E - Trade Financial offers commission - free trading on more than 250 ETFs .
TD Ameritrade offers commission - free access to more than 300 ETFs .
Both Fidelity and Schwab have scale benefits of being both an asset manager and a brokerage platform for trading ETFs , Rosenbluth noted , but he could not speculate on how they would respond . "
Schwab and Fidelity are more likely to come up with similar moves , " Mishra said . "
Both already have commission - free trading for their own ETFs as well as some other issuers . "
Charles Schwab was an early leader with 200-plus commission free ETFs , including its own ETFs and many ETFs from other major providers .
Fidelity has 95 ( its own and many iShares ETFs ) . "
Both are likely to expand these platforms soon , " Mishra said .
Vanguard is making a greater play for the online brokerage business and noted in their release that it has made " considerable enhancements " to its brokerage platform over the past several years .
While the move is a win for investors , it is also important for investors not to place all the emphasis on trading fees , especially as the fee wars at the level of the individual ETF and trading platform will continue .
Similar ETFs in asset class or theme still vary in stock selection , liquidity and trading costs , among other factors .
But it is hard to argue with what investors are telling these ETF companies .
According to a recent annual Schwab ETF survey , 45 percent of millennial and 39 percent of Gen X investors surveyed say commission - free ETFs are most important and they 'd move their account to a firm that offered commission - free . "
CFRA thinks investors need to go beyond what ETFs trade commission - free on certain platforms , but we acknowledge this is a priority for many , " Rosenbluth said .
There is also a risk it becomes too easy and cheap to trade ETFs , something index fund creator and Vanguard founder Jack Bogle has remarked on repeatedly . "
Recent fund flows clearly show that investors are becoming more cost conscious and moving their dollars to the cheapest ETFs .
And while there is no doubt that investors are big winners as the fee war escalates , the downside is that the ease of trading and low transaction costs are also leading investors to trade more often , particularly in volatile markets , " Mishra said .

There 's a certain irony to the great - grandson of the first African - American Ohio Highway Patrolman being the victim of racial profiling .
It 's an irony not lost on Brandy Sharp .
Her youngest son , Uriah , became the target of suspected racial profiling on the first day of his newspaper route .
Mom followed along in the car as Uriah and his older brother hit the streets of Upper Arlington , a suburb of Columbus , to make their deliveries .
About midway through the route , Sharp said she noticed that Uriah had delivered papers to a few wrong addresses .
Familiar with Upper Arlington 's solicitation ordinance , Uriah returned to collect the wrongly delivered papers .
It was then that someone calledUpper Arlington Police to report the junior carrier for suspicious activity , she said .

She was in her car monitoring Uriah 's progress and reading a book .
After about 10 minutes the officer approached her car and asked if they were soliciting .
No further action was taken after her explanation , but Sharp said the experience left her feeling angry .
The anger was not directed at the police .
Her grandfather was Louis Sharp , the first black patrolman hired by the Ohio State Highway Patrol .

Her anger was directed at the person who " profiled " her son . "

I 'm insulted . "

Totally disgusted . "
Sharp continued on Facebook : " * * * My apologies Upper Arlington for bringing my 12 year old African American son into your neighborhood to deliver the paper and make a few dollars on the side ... NO HARM INTENDED . " "
I will make sure my boss changes his route . "
Sharp clarified that her son is 11 .
She was still upset when posting to Facebook and does n't know why she referenced Uriah as 12 .
In a July 8 Facebook post , Upper Arlington Police spoke to the online outrage over the incident .
The police responded to a report of suspicious activity concerning a vehicle and two people on foot walking near Barrington Elementary .
A caller to the police department reported seeing one of the people approach a home empty - handed but leave holding something , the post said .
Response to the departments post was mostly supportive with most commenters lauding the department for its work .
One commenter said the problem was nt with the police , but with residents who " feel compelled to report issues that are benign in nature because of the color of someones skin . "
The paper carriers mother also chimed in on this thread : " Yes I am the mother of the boys that were doing their paper route Friday evening ... to have police called and be accused is so disheartening ... HOW DOES SOMETHING SO HONEST AND HARMLESS get this kind of outcome ... I am VERY UPSET my children have to experience something like this ... every paper was put on the porch and MY CHILDREN DID NOT REMOVE ANYTHING FROM Anyone 's HOME! ... This is insulting and ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING ... maybe next time more investigation should have been done before we just ACCUSE ! "

People should not jump to conclusions of a person 's intent based on skin color . "
To prejudge someone , especially at a young age , is horrible , " Sharp added . "
Anything I can do to make sure this does n't happen to someone else , I 'll do . "

There s been a fair amount of mystery -- and money -- surrounding Magic Leap , a Florida - based " mixed reality " startup that has tried the patience of people who have been waiting a few years now for the companys first product .
That product , the Magic Leap One headset , is apparently getting closer to reality with a Wednesday announcement that AT&T has made a " significant investment " in Magic Leap and will become the exclusive wireless retail partner for the headset in the U.S. Even so , the first version of the headset that Magic Leap subsequently said would come this summer , is pitched only to " qualified designers and developers . "
No pricing has been set but do n't expect to be cheap .
Its still not clear when a consumer version will turn up or what that version will cost , either .
And AT&T is saying that when it does , the initial distribution will be limited to Atlanta , Boston , Chicago , Los Angeles , and San Francisco , with other markets to follow .
The Magic Leap One headset relies in part on " lightfield photonics " to trick our brain into processing digital objects the same way we do real - world objects .
And sensors in the headset can detect surfaces , planes and objects , which Magic Leap has said allows for a digital reconstruction of your physical surroundings .
Whether speedy 5 G networks coming in the next few years helps pump up interest in mixed reality , or , for that matter , virtual reality technologies , remains to be seen .
The tech itself , though , is very cool .
AT&T Communications CEO John Donovan will have " observer rights " on Magic Leaps board .
AT&T did not disclose the size of its financial investment in Magic Leap .
But Magic Leaps technology has already wowed such companies as Google and Chinas Alibaba to the degree that these tech giants , among other companies , have collectively invested more than $ 2 billion in Magic Leap .

A notorious French gangster has managed to escape prison again .
This time , with help from armed friends using a hijacked helicopter and smoke bombs .
Redoine Faid , 46 , who escaped prison five years ago using explosives , broke out of a prison near Paris on Sunday .
He was serving a 25-year sentence for planning a robbery where a police officer was killed .
Two or three men armed with assault rifles hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to fly to Faid 's prison in Seine - et - Marne .
When the helicopter landed , two men dressed all in black , opened the prison door using a grinding machine and took Faid .
At the time , he was meeting with his brother in a visitation room , members of the guards union , told France 's BFM television .
The men set off smoke bombs to blur the scene from video surveillance , union member Loic Delbroc said .

John Schnatter , once the face of Papa John 's and a University of Louisville trustee , sparked immediate backlash this week after dropping a racial slur during a conference call .
The university distanced itself from the pizza magnate but said it has had no discussions about removing the Papa John 's name from its football stadium .
But does playing at Papa John 's Cardinal Stadium mean something different now after Schnatter 's N - word scandal ? "
Anybody with a moral compass would see how that s a little . . .
shall we say . . .
problematic , " tweeted Ricky Jones , a professor at the University of Louisville .
The news of John Schnatter 's comments in May , first reported by Forbes on Wednesday , quickly crumbled the pizza magnate 's already damaged reputation .
Within hours of the report , Schnatter apologized for his words , resigned from the University of Louisville 's board of trustees and stepped down as chairman of the company he built .
Schnatter 's name was dropped from Nachand Fieldhouse in his hometown of Jeffersonville , Indiana , but his name still is all over the region .
Thanks to multimillion - dollar gifts , three university entrepreneurship centers bear his name -- at Purdue , U of L and Ball State , Schnatter 's alma mater .
And , of course , it 's emblazoned on the city 's football stadium , which Schnatter jokingly referred to as his stadium last year . "
We 're getting ready to put $ 60 million in a stadium -- by the way , it 's my stadium -- and we 're $ 5 million over budget and we 've got 10 days of cash .
This is crazy , " Schnatter said at an April board of trustees meeting . " ...
We need to be more prudent with our dollars .
By the way , I mean , I win on the stadium , but it 's not healthy for the university , and that 's just wrong . "
Schnatter holds the stadium 's naming rights , the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting reported last year .
His company is also the exclusive pizza provider at the stadium and during university events .
More : Twitter is roasting Papa John 's founder for using the N - word More : Papa John 's Chairman John Schnatter resigns after apologizing for racial slur A University of Louisville athletics spokesman , Kenny Klein , said Wednesday that he knew of no plans to change the name of the stadium .
And university spokesman John Karman said discussions about renaming the stadium were premature .
Twitter users , though , do n't feel the same way .
The university " needs to immediately remove the stadium name of Papa John Stadium to honor a decent person ; not someone like John Schnatter who lacks character , " one user said . "
I 'll never attend another game there while it bears his name ! "
Others had suggestions for a new name approach . "
Dealer for the people field , " anyone ?

This was the most popular Moneyist advice column of 2018 .
Dear Moneyist , My father passed in 2001 .
He married his wife in 1971 when I was 14 .
I have two blood siblings , and my step - mother had one daughter ; they are very close .
My stepmother is now 91 and in failing health .
My wife and I traveled 1,000 miles to stay with her during her recovery from pneumonia , and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease last week .
We have always gotten along well together and , over the years , my siblings have been very nice to her . " '
I realized I was looking at the looting of my dads estate -- and all the money had been drained by my step - sister and her husband . "
Before my dad passed , we had a frank and clear discussion about his estate .
He had worked and invested and had more than $ 1 million in his estate , which he clearly stated to me was to be split four equal ways upon the death of his wife .
She was also provided for by his companys life insurance policy , and the $ 600,000 from the sale of his Southern California home .
During our visit , she offered to have us stay in her home .
I was going through the old picture albums , and taking some cell phone camera shots of my kids .
There were nt a lot , mostly of her daughter .
Do nt miss : These are the pricey summer camps where wealthy kids go to feel ' normal One of the picture albums had financial documents in it , and I soon realized I was looking at the looting of my dads estate -- and all the money had been drained by my step - sister and her husband .
I d like to say I was shocked , but really it was almost a validation .
My stepsisters husband has been on disability for 18 years .
Each year , their whole family of 6 takes at least 2 cruises .
They drive new cars , and there was plenty of money for my stepsister to buy a business for her son .
Also see : My youngest child will inherit millions from my husband -- should I cut her out of my will ?
I did nt see the will when my dad died , but somehow he left it so that in certain circumstance , if his wifes income fell to a certain level , they were able to access my dads estate principle .
In 2009 , my stepsister and her husband took out a $ 750,000 single - premium life insurance on my stepmom .
They borrowed $ 617,000 from my fathers life insurance policy , and the surrender value and death benefit are now about $ 120,000 .
They also wrote my stepmoms trust and so that my stepsister gets 75 % of any distribution , and the other three kids share equally of the remaining 25 % . "
My stepsiblings wrote my stepmoms trust and so that my stepsister gets 75 % of any distribution and the other three kids share the remaining 25 % . "
My stepmom brought very little in assets into the marriage -- just a small home in California , which was nt worth much .
She had no other major assets .
The life insurance policy was paid in full at the time of issue , and the money had to come from my fathers estate .
Even if we fight it now , the money has been gone for 9 years , and now that stepmom is in poor health we can see that , from our expected $ 250,000 distribution from dads estate , the blood issue kids will be very lucky to get even $ 5,000 after probate and taxes .
I am lucky that I ve worked hard and invested well that it wo nt be a problem for my wife and I. My brother is on a pension from the state of California and is OK , but my sister and husband are going to be hit hard by this .
She has been counting on that estate for 20 years to fund her own retirement , and its not going to be there .
Recommended : I asked my son to buy a condo unit with me as an investment -- now I want my money A word of warning to your readers : Do nt trust anyone .
I m going to get a lawyer , and fight it for the hell of it , but even after I win a judgment , the money has been spent , and well never get anything out of it .
Any other suggestions ?
Distraught Dear Distraught , These stepsiblings are absolutely attempting to cheat you out of your inheritance .
If your father did not leave a will , the probate court should have divided the estate in accordance with the law in the state of California .
If you father died intestate ( without a will ) in California , community property goes to the surviving spouse , receives one - third of the total separate property if there s more than one child with the rest divided among the children .
Gather any documents you can on your stepfamilys financial transactions as evidence , obtained legally .
But it may be too late .
There is a statute of limitations on an oral promise in California . "
The applicable statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit to enforce an oral promise to make a will or trust is one year from the date of death of the person , " according to Sweeney Probate Law , which has offices across the state .
Anyone contesting a will has 120 days after it has been admitted to probate .
You may have better luck with the statute of limitations in relation to fraud .
You must file a lawsuit within three years of discovering the fraud or three years " within reasonable diligence " where you could have discovered those facts .
The latter sounds like a more moveable date that is open to challenge .
Your lawyer will best advice you on your options . "
Your stepmother may or may not have been an accomplice to these transactions .
What is clear : Your stepsiblings saw an opportunity to transfer this wealth . "
Your stepmother may or may not have been an accomplice to these transactions .
What is clear : Your stepsiblings saw an opportunity to transfer this wealth .
Obtain a copy of all life insurance policies , compile a timeline of events .
You may have a case for breach of contract of the life insurance policy and/or elder abuse ( if your stepsiblings carried out these shenanigans while your stepmother was mentally impaired ) and even fraudulent wire transfer .
If you have an experienced probate attorney , he / she may have another solution relating to fraud .
But you may be out of luck .
You were correct not to rely on your stepmother and her family to honor your fathers wishes , but the statute of limitations and trying to find money after its been drained from multiple accounts present dual challenges for you .
If nothing else , it serves as a timely warning to leave nothing to chance .

Thomas Maresca Special to USA TODAY MAE SAI , Thailand - The brave faces of young soccer players trapped in a flooded cave .
Intrepid rescues .
Pounding monsoon rains looming in the distance .
And a spellbound world watching every nervous twist and turn , rooting on the Wild Boars as at least a dozen countries helped in the effort to pull them to safety .
And finally Tuesday , these words : They are all out .
It is a story made for Hollywood - and Hollywood stands ready .
A pair of American producers with ties to Thailand , Michael Scott and Adam Smith , have spent the past few days in the area around the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Chiang Rai province laying the groundwork for what they think will become a worldwide blockbuster . "
So often in the news , its so dark and gloomy , and this is something that everybody can watch and be inspired by , " said Scott , managing partner of Pure Flix , a production company based in Scottsdale , Arizona , and Los Angeles .
The company focuses on faith and inspirational movies , and Scott said the tale of the team trapped for two weeks has all the ingredients for a major hit that will draw A - list talent . "
I think this film is such an inspiring story , " he said . "
All the stuff that happened on the Thai side , you ve got the international divers teams - I think it will attract some really incredible screenwriters , directors and actors to the project . "
Scott is married to a Thai woman , and they spend part of the year in Thailand .
He said he had been following the events closely on television when a tragic turn struck a personal chord with his family that made him even more determined to tell the story .
His wife is a former classmate of Saman Kunan , the former Thai Navy Seal who died early Friday while placing oxygen canisters underwater along the route to the stranded boys . "
My wife was shocked when she saw it on the news , " Scott said , adding that he planned to dedicate the film to Saman .

Tim OConnor tries to keep himself active in retirement , teaching English as a second language to adults in New York City , and staying fit to ward off health problems . "
I do n't have a great cardiac family history in my family , " the retired attorney explained .
When his longtime doctor converted to a concierge medicine practice with a $ 2,100 annual fee per person , Tim and his wife decided they d pay to keep their doctor .
It was a decision they weighed carefully , now that they re on a fixed income . "
Is money a consideration ?
I do n't want to say it 's not a consideration .
But I do believe in preventive medicine , " OConnor said .
For the OConnors , the fee provides them with unlimited access for same - day appointments , longer visits and a comprehensive annual physical .
For their doctor , converting his practice has meant being able to provide more personalized care to about 500 patients -- about a quarter of the size of his old practice . "
If someone has three , four , five ( health ) conditions , it 's impossible to see them in a 10-minute period , " said Dr. Peter Zeale , a cardiologist with the MDVIP concierge medical group . "
So , you have the time to ... sit down with them , go through each problem and try and direct them in the right direction .
And I do n't know how you can do that in the traditional model . "
While concierge medicine and other fee - based primary care practices have been around for decades , they make up less than 10 percent of physician practices , nationally according to a number of health industry surveys .
Cost is a big deterrent for a lot of patients , especially since they still need to pay for health insurance on top of the concierge fee .
But now the Trump administration could give some fee - based practices a boost .
Earlier this year , the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services put out a request for information to health - care providers , asking how the administration could help fund access to some fee - based practices for Medicare patients .

Tom Lee , the only major Wall Street strategist to issue bitcoin price targets , told CNBC on Thursday morning he sees the world 's largest cryptocurrency by the end of the year at more than $ 20,000 per unit .
That 's 20 percent less than his $ 25,000 target .
However , Lee later clarified his position on " Fast Money , " saying Thursday evening he " may have misspoke a little bit " and still stands by his $ 25,000 forecast .
It all started when the Fundstrat Global Advisors co - founder said on " Squawk Box " that " bitcoin has historically traded at 2.5 times its mining costs . " "
The reason bitcoin looks really good here is the cost of mining around $ 7,000 fully loaded .
And the difficulty is rising .
So by the end of the year , it 's going to be $ 9,000 , " he said Thursday morning .
Crypto miners use high powered computers that use a lot of electricity to complete a series of complex calculations to create a bitcoin .
The protocol calls for a finite number of bitcoins of 21 million , of which about 80 percent have already been made .
In the afternoon on CNBC , Lee said those mining costs estimates " imply fair value over $ 20,000 , roughly $ 22,000 . "
But he added , " We still think bitcoin can reach $ 25,000 by the end of the year or something like that . "
Lee stressed that investors should not quibble over a few thousand dollars because any return exceeding $ 20,000 would be about 200 percent higher than current levels around $ 6,600 in early Friday trading .
Bitcoin at $ 6,600 brings prices back to the lows in April , which marked the halt of a slide from nearly $ 20,000 in late 2017 .
Since its most recent top around $ 9,800 in May , bitcoin has lost about 30 percent .
Lee , chief equity strategist J.P. Morgan from 2007 to 2014 , said he believes bitcoin and blockchain , the technology underlying it , is a " multidecade story " that 's in the " early stages " of transformation . "

Its all about time horizon ... If you look at the second half ( of the year ) , I think there s quite a lot of bad news priced in at the moment , both on the trade front , obviously political uncertainty outside of trade is pretty elevated , so we are still overweight equities , " Bell told CNBCs " Squawk Box Europe . " "
Once you start to look beyond that ( end of the year ) , the story becomes a little bit more complicated , " he added .

Treasury yields climbed on Monday after a sold retail sales figure highlighted the robust U.S. economy , an environment in which the Federal Reserve may feel comfortable raising interest rates at its current pace even as a potential U.S.-China trade conflict looms .
The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD01Y , 0.259 % rose 2.6 basis points to 2.856 % .
The 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.586 % added 1.8 basis points to 2.601 % .
The 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y , 1.776 % climbed 3.2 basis point to 2.965 % , the largest one - day yield jump since June 20 .
Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields .
What s driving markets ?
The U.S. economy continued to show signs of strength .
Retail sales in June came in at a 0.5 % increase , matching the forecast of a 0.5 % increase from economists polled by MarketWatch .
The boost in spending comes after data showed the rise in consumer prices hit a six - year high .
Meanwhile , the Empire State manufacturing index , a gauge of the local economys strength in New York state , fell in July to a reading of 22.6 from an eight - month high of 25 , but is nonetheless a robust figure as all readings above zero signify improving conditions .
With President Donald Trump finishing his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Finland , investors have shifted their attention back to a strong economy .
Solid growth and higher inflation should weigh on bond prices in part because they could give the Fed added support for raising rates at their current pace .
The central banks dot plot , an aggregate of senior Fed officials forecast for the fed - funds rate , shows the current tightening cycle should end at 2.9 % .
The optimistic outlook for the U.S. economy contrasts with China , after a downbeat report in the worlds second largest economy suggested it was ill - prepared for a trade conflict .
Chinas second - quarter GDP grew at 6.7 % year - over - year , its slowest pace since 2016 , from 6.8 % in the first quarter .
Last week , the Trump administration said it planned to impose tariffs on a list of $ 200 billion Chinese imports .
The simmering trade tensions have kept a lid on Treasury yields by drawing skittish investors into the perceived safety of U.S. government paper .
See : China growth slows slightly in second quarter The headline - grabbing event for this week , however , is likely to be Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells testimony in front of Congress as part of the semiannual policy outlook .
In remarks last week , Powell cited the U.S.s solid economic momentum , saying it should keep the central bank on track for its current rate - hike trajectory .
At the same time , he said tariffs could hurt the growth picture .
Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday .

Yields could be on the rise because of upward revisions to the last retail sales figures .
The other thing is were getting through some of the event risks .
Trump is meeting Putin , once that goes by , investors wo nt have to focus on the geopolitical issues as much and focus on the strong cyclicals underpinning the U.S. economy , " said Jim Caron , a money manager for Morgan Stanley Investment Management . "
At this point , a September [ interest - rate ] increase is fully priced into the market with the upside risk of a fourth - round hike come December .
While stronger inflation supports the hawkish argument to move forward with an end - of - the - year increase , potentially taking the fed - funds rate to 2.50 % , ample uncertainty surrounding the longer - term implications for topline growth , job creation and earnings will reaffirm the need for patience , " said Lindsey Piegza , chief economist for Stifel , in a Monday note .
Treasury yields rose Wednesday after the Federal Reserve Beige Book highlighted growing wage pressures from a tight labor market , an environment that should keep the central bank on track to raise rates at its pace of one hike every three months .
The 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y , 1.433 % rose 1.3 basis points to 2.875 % , while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y , 1.770 % picked up 1.9 basis points to 2.989 % .
The 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y , 0.579 % was down 0.4 basis point to 2.611 % , retaining its yield peak near 2008 .
Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields .
What s driving the bond market ?
The bond market focused on signs of labor shortages and wage pressures after the Feds Beige Book report , a survey of executives and businesses throughout the Feds districts .
Companies reported difficulties finding qualified workers amid rising costs of commodities and raw materials .
See : Worker shortages , rising costs hemming in a U.S. economy bursting at the seams , Feds Beige Book finds Economists say for inflation to trend higher in the long - term , the labor markets tightness will need to translate into wage gains .
Inflation is doubly bearish on bond prices as it erodes the value of bonds fixed - interest payments , and can accelerate the central banks pace of monetary tightening , compelling selling in long - dated Treasurys as investors await richer yielding offerings .
Investors also watched Powells testimony in front of the House Financial Services Committee .
Powell repeated the need for gradual rate increases and answered questions on the reduction of its balance sheets .
Powell said it was nt clear when the central bank should stop winding down its bloated portfolio of securities , a legacy of the Feds fight to stimulate growth after the financial crisis , which stands presently at more than $ 4 trillion .
See : For the first time , Powell says more rate increases are right path ' for now On the data front , housing starts for June came in at a 1.173 million annual pace , a nine - month low , well below the 1.303 million consensus estimate form economists polled by MarketWatch .
The Treasury International Capitol Report showed foreign holdings of Treasurys had risen to $ 6.214 trillion in May from $ 6.169 trillion the previous month .
Though the data could signal stronger appetite for Treasurys , the uptick in the value of foreign holdings could reflect how U.S. government bonds rallied in May , when the benchmark 10-year yield fell sharply from a seven - year high of 3.12 % to end at 2.82 % for the month .
Read : Stock investors should not fear the inverted yield curve , strategist says What did market participants say ? "
We think its more critical to watch the labor market in this point in time .
We have a lot of interest in labor shortages and how is that going to affect the Fed , more so than the trade fears .
If you look at tariff effects , they re hard to measure , " said Victoria Fernandez , chief market strategist for Crossmark Global Investments . "
The labor issue is something the Fed is keenly watching , there s a lot of labor shortages , and most of the companies are saying they do nt have the workers they need , " said Fernandez .

U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday eked out a victory in her battle to pass her Brexit plan through Parliament .

This led to a new slew of criticism for May , who has been called too soft in her negotiations with Brussels and whose power in her administration has been questioned for months .
Had May lost Tuesday 's vote , it could have triggered a leadership crisis that could have resulted in a vote of confidence and fresh elections .
Just last week , the government saw high profile resignations from chief Brexit negotiator David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson , as well as two vice - chairs of the Conservative Party .

Core inflation slipped to 1.9 % , falling below the Bank of Englands 2 % target .

U.S. government debt yields slipped on the last trading day of the week after the Department of Labor reported that the economy added more jobs than expected in June , but the unemployment rate ticked higher .
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was lower at around 2.829 percent at 11:26 a.m. ET , while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was lower at 2.934 percent .
Bond yields move inversely to prices .
The Department of Labor reported Friday that the economy added 213,000 jobs throughout the month of June , but the unemployment rate ticked back up to 4 percent .
Economists polled by Reuters expected gain of 195,000 jobs . "
I thought it was a very good number for the financial markets , both for equities and fixed income , " said Gary Pollack , head of fixed - income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management . "
It shows the labor market continues to growth , but not so much as to push inflation too much . "
In addition to the payroll gains , average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent year over year , or up 0.2 percent month over month , a bit below expectations of a 2.8 percent increase .
U.S. homeowners today are getting richer by the minute , but they are less likely to cash in on their newfound wealth than during previous housing booms .
As home values rise , home equity lines of credit , often used to tap home equity , are flatlining , and the overall amount of money people are taking out of their homes is shrinking .
The collective amount of so - called tappable equity , which is the appraised value of a home minus the 20 percent most lenders require borrowers to keep as a safety net , grew by 7 percent in the first quarter of this year compared with the previous quarter , according to Black Knight , a mortgage software and analytics company .
That is the largest single - quarter growth since the company began tracking it in 2005 .
It is up 16.5 percent compared with a year ago .
A homeowner trims her yard in the Kenwood Park neighborhood of Bethesda , Md. Benjamin C. Tankersley | For The Washington Post | Getty Images Homeowners now have a collective $ 5.8 trillion in tappable equity , the highest volume ever recorded and 16 percent above the last home price peak in 2006 .
The average homeowner with a mortgage gained $ 14,700 in tappable equity over the past year and has $ 113,900 available to draw .
This is the amount over and above 20 percent of the value of the average home .
Variable interest rate fears But HELOCs , on the other hand , have variable interest rates , unlike the 30-year fixed primary mortgage , so the rate on a HELOC can change .
A HELOC is therefore more risky because the Federal Reserve has been raising rates steadily , and HELOCs follow that . "
Who wants uncertainty when it comes to monthly finances , " said Ben Graboske , executive vice president of Black Knights Data & Analytics division . "
I think a lot of Americans look at , what are my payments ?
What is my income coming in and what are my payments going out ?
They want certainty that they can cover their costs and not worry about it . "
Nearly 80 percent of tappable equity is held by homeowners whose current mortgage interest rate is below 4.5 percent , and 60 percent of it is held by borrowers whose rate is below 4 percent .
The average rate on the 30-year fixed today is around 4.8 percent , according to the Mortgage Bankers Association .
Still , those who are tapping equity are doing it more through cash - out refinances than HELOCs .
Originations for HELOCs are flat , and the amount of equity being withdrawn on HELOCs that are originated is at a two - year low .
More borrowers are doing cash - out refinances , even at a higher interest rate , because they are leery of the variable rates on HELOCs .
But overall , just 1.17 percent of available equity was tapped in the first quarter of this year , the lowest amount in four years .
Why ?
They may not know just how rich they are . "
I think the typical American does n't have that level of awareness , they 're not probably studying the numbers , " added Graboske .
Memories of the housing crash
U.S. malls have n't been this empty since 2012 , when the retail industry was clawing its way back after the Great Recession , according to a new report from real estate research firm Reis .
The vacancy rate at regional and super regional malls reached 8.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018 , based on a survey by Reis of 77 metropolitan areas across the country .
That was up from 8.4 percent in the prior period , and a high not seen since the third quarter of 2012 , when the vacancy rate was 8.7 percent .
The news comes as more consumers shop online and Amazon steals market share from traditional retailers .
The industry 's been struggling to survive , with many companies closing physical stores or reorganizing altogether in bankruptcy .
Some have n't made it at all .
It 's put millions of square feet of store space back on the market this year , much of that within shopping malls .
Department store chain Bon - Ton went bankrupt , shuttering hundreds of stores , while Sears continues to trim its real estate portfolio .
Toys R Us , an anchor at many open - air strip centers across the U.S. , filed for bankruptcy late last year and just last week closed all of its locations for good .
Retailers were once rewarded for opening as many locations as possible , with square footage almost synonymous with the success of a business .
With consumer shopping habits shifting online , brick - and - mortar stores have become expensive and redundant .
According to Reis , the vacancy rate is n't expected to improve in the near future .
A report from Credit Suisse has predicted that 25 percent of U.S. malls will close by 2022 .
Still , there were some bright spots in the data .
Those U.S. mall owners with top - tier properties or more heavily trafficked malls have maintained power over their tenants , as rents grew about 0.3 percent in the second quarter against a backdrop of heightened vacancies , Reis said .
Real estate investment trusts such as Simon , Macerich , GGP , Taubman and Unibail - Rodamco - Westfield have been filling shuttered storefronts with more restaurants , pop - up shops and experiential and service - oriented tenants such as gyms and walk - in medical clinics .
A cloud hanging over the retail real estate industry has meanwhile prompted a wave of mergers and acquisitions , with many public landlords trading at a heavy discount on the Street .
Westfield was recently purchased by European property owner Unibail - Rodamco .
Brookfield Property Partners is in the process of buying GGP .
And activist investors are targeting Taubman and Macerich .

U.S. oil prices finished sharply lower on Monday , at their lowest in more than three weeks .
Analysts attributed the drop to talk of a possible release of crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve , a report showing a slowdown in global economic growth , and the potential for U.S. waivers on Iran oil sanctions .
August West Texas Intermediate crude clq8 lost $ 2.95 , or nearly 4.2 % , to settle at $ 68.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
That was the lowest for a most - active contract since June 21 , according to FactSet data .
U.S. oil prices finished with a gain on Wednesday , reversing earlier losses that were fed by a surprise climb in U.S. crude inventories and record weekly domestic production .
Prices managed to extend a modest gain from a day earlier , which followed news of fresh production woes in Libya .

What is driving the market ?
The Feds Beige Book revealed a domestic economy that has rapidly expanded , but one that has run out of room to grow much faster as shortages of skilled workers and rising costs of raw materials risk impeding another leg of expansion .
The anecdotal account of business conditions in the Feds 12 districts showed that 11 regions of the country were growing at a " modest " pace or even faster .
Only the states around St. Louis reported " slight " growth .
Thus far , Wall Street moves have been influenced by economic reports and earnings .
The most recent data , indicates that nearly 90 % of the companys that have thus far reported quarterly results have beaten profit forecasts , establishing a solid trend for Wall Street .
Beyond , the economic narrative from the Feds Beige Book and earnings , investors watched Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterate many of his statements made Tuesday , in his last testimony in front of congressional lawmakers .
Testifying on Wednesday in front of the House Financial Services Committee , Powell emphasized the U.S. central banks desire to raise rates further this year and said he sees few signs that an economic recession , which has become a bugaboo for investors , is on the horizon .
On Tuesday , Powell offered a similarly sanguine outlook for the economy and indicated interest rates will continue to go up every three months " for now . "
Earlier in the day , Larry Kudlow , economic adviser to President Donald Trump , speaking Wednesday at a sponsored by CNBC in New York , said additional pro - growth measures could be imminent , which could deliver a further jolt to the U.S. economy .
What are strategists saying ? "
It all still comes down to earnings and interest rates and so far were good on earnings and we know from Jerome Powell , that the interest - rate picture is pretty predictable , " said Ken Winans , president of Winans Investments based in Novato , Calif. , who manages about $ 210 million . "

UNION - As the young kids quietly sat at attention in a circle at midfield of Kean Alumni Field Eli Manning stepped in front of them in shorts and T - shirt , a Gatorade towel draped over his shoulders , and began to speak . "
My name is Eli Manning , " he said . "
I play quarterback for the Giants . "
Maybe it was just a formality , but it was worth noting that Manning needed to introduce himself to kids , a 37-year - old still sticking around in a world of what have you done to get on a top 10 highlight list today .
And maybe it was something he had to assert , too , that he was still the Giants quarterback after last seasons troubling decision - making by management as the franchise struggled on the field and seemed ready to replace him .
The coach and general manager were fired and Manning got the backing of the new general manager , Dave Gettleman , and the new head coach , Pat Shurmur .
The Giants passed on a quarterback with the No .
2 pick in the draft , throwing their faith into Manning again .
So he still is Eli Manning , quarterback for the Giants . "
Its still an excitement , " Manning said . "
It kind of proves to yourself that you still should be doing this .
I look forward to it .
I work hard all the summer to get ready for the upcoming season , to get ready for training camp .
I know I still can perform at a high level , play great football , win a lot of football games . "
He did nt exactly leak out that he is an elite quarterback , but that might just be a matter of semantics , the difference between , " elite " and " high level . "
But he believes that the faith in his play that Gettleman and Shurmur have showed is not misplaced .
Gettleman was a vocal advocate for Manning , insisting that he believed that he not only could be the quarterback now , but for years to come .
But he is now away from the team , fighting a battle with cancer . "
I m just saying a prayer for him and his family , " Manning said . "
He s a great guy and all of the Giants family are there for him , backing him up .
We ve talked a little bit and I know he s doing everything he has to do to get better . "
Manning was out for a promotional appearance on this morning , appearing at the Offense - Defense Football Camp and the towel was not just to wipe away sweat , but an advertisement for his part as spokesman in Gatorades Beat the Heat program .
But he has been on the field at voluntary and mandatory workouts this summer , acclimating to the new system and working on a fit with the new pieces - particularly the running back who the Giants took with that No .
2 overall pick , Saquon Barkley .
In less than two weeks , even with 14 seasons already in the league , Manning will report early to camp with the rookies - three days ahead of the rest of the squad - as part of Shurmurs program that requires the quarterbacks in with that early crew . "
Its a first , a first for me , " he said . "
I think it ll be good .
Looking forward to it .
Obviously , with the new offense and new terminology to kind of get there a few days early and just get that kind of the mind working the right way , get all your calls down , get a little introduction to that again and get refreshed with everything , I m looking forward to getting in there and getting a little jumpstart . "
I think I ve worked hard every offseason .
It does nt change .
Always come in in shape , throwing a lot , doing everything to keep on pace and always make improvements .
Always trying to get better and find things you need to work on .
So I ve had a good offseason .
During the spring , learning a new offense it takes more time in the classroom just to learn the offense , doing that studying .
I m trying to do whatever it takes to get where we want to go . "
If they have resolved their quarterback controversy the Giants have nt exactly solved all of their problems as they ready for the season to begin .
Odell Beckham Jr. remains in search of a new contract .
But all of the pieces seem intent on making things work on the field better than last season when the Giants plummeted to a 3 - 13 season .
He was asked if he had seen the videos of Beckham Jr. , Evan Engram , Barkley , Sterling Sheppard and Roger Lewis working out at UCLA - shirtless . "
Yeah , I ve seen a couple of videos , " Manning said , noting that they were always shirtless .
While he said he appreciated the work , he joked , " I know they ll have to make some adjustments .
We do practice with our shirts on with the Giants - the friction , they ll have to make an adjustment the first few weeks .
Might be something new for them and take a little while for them to get used to that .
Besides that , I know those guys , its great that they re together , they re challenging each other and getting excited for the upcoming season . "
Spoken like a leader of the team .
He still is that , still Eli Manning , quarterback for the Giants .

USA TODAY BRUSSELS -- President Trump takes questions following a second day of discussions at the NATO summit .
On Wednesday , Trump did n't tread lightly when speaking to US allies .
The president claimed Germany is " a captive of Russia " during a breakfast on Wednesday .
He addressed NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg , a stand - in for German Chancellor Angela Merkel , and complained about a gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany that the German government approved . "
Germany is totally controlled by Russia , because they will be getting from 60 to 70 percent of their energy from Russia and a new pipeline . "
Before leaving for London , Trump is set to participate in a pair of multilateral meetings focused on Russian aggression and the war in Afghanistan .
USA TODAY is providing live coverage of Trump 's press conference in the player above .
USA TODAY Federal officials said only 34 young children ( out of more than 100 ) separated from parents at the border under a " zero tolerance " policy will be reunited with parents in time to comply with a court deadline .
The horror has n't ended President Donald Trump 's suggestion Tuesday that the solution to the humanitarian crisis of family separation is that families should stop seeking entry to the U.S. is nonsensical .
The administration has manufactured this crisis itself by adopting inhumane , unlawful and fiscally unsound policies .
Its failure to reunite children under 5 years of age -- toddlers -- with their parents by a federal judges deadline shows the incredible toll this policy is taking on families , as well as the costly logistical nightmare it has created .
If the president is looking for solutions , he should terminate the senseless , wasteful prosecution of families crossing the border , some of whom have legitimate legal claims for protection .
He should stop separating children from their parents .
And he should not seek to incarcerate families indefinitely as an alternative to separation .

Family detention has proven both physically and mentally detrimental to childrens growth and development .
Detained families are also often unable to find absolutely critical legal representation in these remote mass incarceration sites .
Many who may qualify for asylum could end up losing their cases simply because they are detained .
Additionally , putting families in prison places a costly burden on American taxpayers .
It costs hundreds of dollars per day to detain a child , and we know the administration is seeking to build additional centers .
Litigation by the Justice Department to seek approval for indefinite detention of families is also costly .
A federal judge had already ruled that children could not be detained indefinitely , yet the administration , again , sought to litigate this decision and may seek further appeals .
In fact , cheaper , more humane and more effective programs -- such as the family case management system -- already exist , and were developed after years of litigation and advocacy during the prior administration .
But this administration chose to terminate these programs in favor of draconian , dehumanizing measures .
Congress should not approve the expenditure of our tax dollars on the construction or use of prisons for children , the prosecution of border crossers who do not pose a threat to our safety , or the separation of families .
Reunification of families must be accomplished expeditiously .
With all the damage the administration has already done to our nations reputation , the rule of law and the human beings impacted by its policies , meeting the federal courts deadlines is the least it could do Archi Pyati is the chief of policy for the Tahirih Justice Center .

Instead , the administration has made it more difficult , leaving desperate people with few choices .

And they are , by the way , people -- not hordes , not insects , not ' illegals . '

In Wednesday 's seimfinal game , Croatia and England will square off at the same stadium that will host the final -- Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow .
While England is busy singing " Football 's coming home " as it carries on its quest for its first World Cup win in 52 years , a potential distraction entered Croatia 's camp on Monday .
While Harry Kane is the favorite for the World Cup 's Golden Boot award with a tournament - best six goals , it 's England 's goalkeeper who also has been instrumental in getting the Three Lions to the brink of history .
Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford played just three games for England before the World Cup , but has played like a veteran to help his team reach the semifinals of a World Cup for the first time since 1990 .
Croatia forward Mario Mandzukic is the biggest threat to Pickford 's goal .
Feeding the ball to Mandzukic is Luka Modric , one of the best players on the planet .
One thing working against Croatia is how many minutes it has played to advance to the semifinal .

Valeant Pharmaceutical International Inc. will start trading under a new name and ticker symbol on Monday as it switches to the name Bausch Health Cos .
Inc. and ticker " BCH . "
The company has also launched a new corporate website at www.bauschhealth.com .
Bausch stems from the company 's well - known Bausch & Lomb eye products line .
The name change comes after a rocky few years for the drug company , which was swept up in a drug pricing and accounting scandal that led to the ouster of its CEO .
It 's the company 's second scandal - inspired name change in less than 10 years .
In 2010 , after the troubled pharmaceutical company Biovail acquired Valeant , the combined company went by the name Valeant instead .
The stock has gained 12.6 % in 2018 , while the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has gained 4.8 % .
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. is hoping that a new name will put a rocky few years and an accounting scandal behind it -- again .
The company began trading under Bausch Health Companies Inc. BHC , -3.52 % and a new ticker , BHC , on Monday .
It marks the companys second scandal - inspired name change in less than 10 years .
In 2010 , after the troubled pharmaceutical company Biovail acquired Valeant , the combined company went by the name Valeant instead .
Rebranding is a time - honored tool for companies , giving them a fresh start and bringing them closer to what they want to be known for , said Carreen Winters , chairman of reputation and chief strategy officer at public affairs agency MWWPR .
In Valeants case , that would be its well - known Bausch + Lomb eye products line , which sells contact lenses , dry eye products , prescription eye products , surgical products and more .
The business unit brought in $ 4.9 billion in revenue last year , making it by far Valeants biggest unit by revenue .
But any name - change must be both understood and accompanied by real change , Winters and other experts say .
And while it may work to shed a bad reputation among consumers , it wo nt work on everyone . "
Investors are incentivized to follow your company .
So you re not going to fool them when you change your name , " Winters said . "
Financial statements do nt go away -- they follow you . "
Related : Valeants tangled web of allegations Many companies have used new names to signal something different about themselves , or escape the taint of scandal .
Bed n Bath , for example , changed to Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY , -6.66 % to show that it had expanded and sold a wider variety of products .
After a major crash that killed more than 100 people on board , discount airline ValuJet bought AirTran and went by that name ; it was later acquired by Southwest LUV , -4.17 % .
And the Lance Armstrong Foundation changed its name to the Livestrong Foundation after the doping scandal surrounding its founder .
But a name change wo nt be successful unless the business is substantively changed , branding experts say .
In recent years , Valeant was home to a major accounting scandal regarding its specialty pharmacy network , Philidor , as well as criticism of its practice of buying drugs and hiking their prices .
Valeant later shut down Philidor and now has new leadership , including new Chief Executive Joseph Papa .

See : How a ' new Valeant could emerge under change of leadership The companys latest rebranding dates back to a similar move by the Canadian pharmaceutical company Biovail , which acquired drugmaker Valeant , then based in the U.S. , in 2010 , in a tax inversion deal .
After the acquisition , the combined company took Valeants name , tagging an " Inc. " to the end , and put Valeants CEO , J. Michael Pearson -- who oversaw Valeants more recent scandals -- in charge .
The company , however , kept Biovails corporate structure and remained based in Canada .
At the time , Biovail was in the middle of its own accounting scandal and embroiled in litigation , including a charge of accounting fraud , with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
The SEC alleged that Biovail had overstated earnings and hidden losses , and misled investors and analysts about the reasons for its poor financial performance ; Valeant later settled a civil suit .
It is common for a company to change its name after merging , experts say .
But it can only do it so many times before it becomes less effective , Winters said .
Associating the company more closely with its Bausch + Lomb line helps Valeant leverage and escalate positive associations with the line , said Richard Swain , vice president of brand strategy and identity for digital marketing firm Huge .
But " the challenge with that is , if they ever had the intention of divesting Bausch + Lomb as an entity , its going to be difficult now that they ve attached the name to the corporate , brand name , " Swain said .
Moreover , " if behaviors do nt change , the negative association could transfer to Bausch + Lomb , which obviously would nt be a good thing . " (
For what its worth , Valeant did get subpoenaed by the Department of Justice regarding Bausch + Lomb in 2015 ) .
Valeant was reportedly considering selling part of its Bausch + Lomb business last summer , Bloomberg reported , and selling the entire business unit has been floated as a way to reduce or eliminate the companys debt .
The new name is likely to be met with criticism , because people do nt like change , Swain said .
Aligning itself with Bausch + Lomb also wo nt address a common criticism of Valeant , that it does nt develop any new drugs itself .
The company bought Bausch + Lomb in 2013 .
VAN METER , Iowa -- Garrett Matthias endured months of brutal treatment for a rare cancer that ultimately took his life this past Friday .
The 5-year - old 's obituary held a final message : " See ya later , suckas ! "
Garrett of Van Meter , a city of about a thousand people 20 miles west of Des Moines , was first diagnosed with alveolar fusion negative rhabdomyosarcoma in September .
The rare cancer attacked his temporal bone , cranial nerve and inner ear .
Throughout Garrett 's treatment , his mother , Emilie Matthias met many other families with children battling pediatric cancer .
She and her husband , Ryan , went to several funerals in the past nine months .
Garrett would ask where his parents had been and wonder why they came home sad , Emilie Matthias said .
> Jan. 28 : Man leaves behind Miracle Whip , Hamburger Helper , rollicking obit > August 2016 : Man 's wife , girlfriend place rival obituaries > July 2015:'Doug Died . '
Man 's amazing obituary is two words long " He would say , ' Why are funerals so sad ?
I 'm going to have bouncy houses at mine , " she recalled .
During this time , Emilie Matthias said she and her husband talked to Garrett about death when the topic arose , such as after a sad moment in a movie . "
I 'd say things like , ' When I die , I want to turn into a star , ' " Emilie Matthias said . "
He 'd say , ' I want to be burned like in Thor , and then I want to become a gorilla . ' "
The two began jotting down Garrett 's comments .
In mid - June , they found out Garrett 's tumors were treatment resistant , and he suffered severe headaches and back pain .
The cancer had surrounded the lining of his brain and prevented the regulation of spinal fluid .
Doctors told Garrett 's parents that his cancer was terminal .
It was then that Emilie and Ryan Matthias decided they did n't want to Garrett to have a normal funeral , sans bouncy houses .
That same desire translated to Garrett 's obituary .
They began to ask him questions similar to those on a getting - to - know - someone questionnaire . "
We really tried to use his words , and the way that he talked , " Emilie Matthias said . "
Garrett was a very unique individual .
What I really did nt want was for his obituary to be ordinary and to have a really sad funeral .
We ve cried oceans of tears for the last nine months . "
The result was a breathtaking obituary in which Garrett describes things he hates ( pants ) and what he wants to do when he dies ( turn into a gorilla and throw " poo " at his dad ) .
> April 2015 : Family pens candid obituary about daughter 's drug overdose > February 2015 : Are you ready to write your own obituary ?
The obituary is also bold and frank about the horrific treatments Garrett endured , something his mom said she wanted to include .
When Garrett was first diagnosed , doctors were blunt with Ryan and Emilie Matthias about the reality of cancer treatment .
So his mom knew what would happen : It 's not those beautiful commercials with these kids with bald heads that are smiling and everyone is cured .
They were upfront that chemo is poison , radiation , burns .
The other way is to cut it out .
You choose and make hard decisions about poisoning , burning and cutting your child .
Those are things nobody should have to do .
Those should nt be the ways we treat our kids .
Cancer is horrible .
This kid is awesome , and he died of cancer .
Since Garrett 's death July 6 , the family has received help from neighbors , friends and family .
The obituary also links to a GoFundMe page for the Matthias family .
Garrett 's day care found five bouncy houses for his funeral .
The Saturday memorial and celebration will have snow cones , other carnival fare and fireworks .

Garrett endured nine months of hell before he lost his battle with cancer .
During that time he never lost his sense of humor and loved to tease the doctors and nurses .
From whoopy cushions and sneaking clothes pins on their clothes to ' hazing ' the interns and new staff doctors , he was forever a prankster .
Nothing caught people off guard as his response to ' see ya later alligator ' : See ya later , suckas ! --

VERO BEACH , Fla. -- A man who told officers that he had been charged twice for drunken driving in Missouri assured them he was not drinking and driving this time when he was questioned in a McDonald 's parking lot here .
Instead , Earle Stevens Jr. , 66 , of Vero Beach was downing bourbon only while stopped at traffic signals and stop signs , he told investigators June 27 .
A woman , who was not identified in the officers ' arrest affidavit , had called Indian River County deputies after she said a vehicle behind her in the McDonald 's drive - thru kept striking her rear bumper .
When deputies asked for his driver 's license , Stevens said he never has had one in Florida .
But they did notice he had an open bottle of liquor in a brown paper bag in his passenger seat .

He further explained that he was not drinking while the car was moving and only when he stopped for stop signs and traffic signals , " the affidavit stated .
Stevens also told officers that he had imbibed " actively " from his Jim Beam bourbon bottle as he drove from Port St. Lucie to the McDonald 's in Vero Beach , almost 30 miles .

Vodafone has launched two wearable devices that the telecoms giant said could assist people with mobility issues and give children more independence as they get older .
Designed for those with mobility issues , the V - SOS Band is described as an " emergency alert wristband " with inbuilt technology that can send a message to up to four different contacts .
Features include an SOS alert that can be triggered by pressing a button for three seconds to alert contacts .
The lens color of the band turns red once the alert has been sent , changing to amber to let the user know it has been received by a designated contact - a family member or friend , for example .
When the contact agrees to respond to the emergency , the lens turns green .
Additionally , the band uses an algorithm and in - built accelerometer to detect falls , and can also report periods of inactivity .
The childrens smartwatch , the V - Kids Watch , is connected via Vodafones mobile network , and allows parents to keep in touch with their kids as they become more independent .
It offers a range of services , including location monitoring and messaging .
Parents can also set up " safe zones " for their children , such as the boundaries of a schoolyard or shopping mall .
If a child leaves such a zone , their parent receives an alert on their smartphone . "
Our growing range of V by Vodafone products and services are enabling our customers to stay connected to everyone and everything that matters to them anytime and anywhere , " Serpil Timuray , chief commercial and strategy officer at the Vodafone Group , said in a statement Tuesday .
Timuray added that the new devices would " enable consumers to enjoy greater independence while keeping them safe and secure by being in contact with their families when needed . "
In November , Vodafone made a push into the internet of things ( IOT ) consumer market by launching the V by Vodafone range , which aims to offer people a number of IOT - connected devices to use in and out of the home .
The European Commission describes the IOT as merging " physical and virtual worlds , creating smart environments . "

Wall Street analysts are standing behind Netflix Inc. , despite the companys weaker - than - expected subscriber growth in the second quarter .
Most see the streaming companys subscriber miss as simply growing pains , something to be expected as Netflix NFLX , -3.76 % works to expand its reach and figures out the right balance of content spend and marketing . "
Our longer - term view of growth potential is unchanged , " analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets , led by Andy Hargreaves , wrote in a Monday note after Netflix announced its earnings results .
Although KeyBanc lowered its price target to $ 375 from $ 385 based on " a decline to our near - term estimates , " Hargreaves reiterated KeyBancs overweight rating , writing : " We continue to recommend owning Netflix . "
Read : Netflix stock slammed after earnings , as subscriber growth and revenue fall short Netflix shares were down 12.6 % in premarket trade Tuesday morning after the Los Gatos , Calif.-based company announced it added 5.15 million streaming users in the second quarter , a 17 % drop from the 6.2 million estimate the company provided in April .
The company added 4.47 million international subscribers and 670,000 domestic subscribers , missing its April estimates of 5.9 million and 1.2 million .
But several investment firms are seeing the misses and resulting pullback as a buying opportunity .
Stifel analysts , led by Scott Devitt , upgraded their Netflix rating on Tuesday to buy from hold , " as we believe shares are again at an attractive point . " "
We view Netflixs long - term outlook positively , given the upside case we believe exists for the companys domestic and international opportunities , " Devitt wrote . "
While 2Q net adds and the 3Q outlook are disappointing , we do not believe they reflect a fundamental change in the Netflix story , " analysts at J.P. Morgan wrote in a note Tuesday morning , raising its price target to $ 415 from $ 385 and reiterating its overweight rating . "
We believe the pullback will prove to be a compelling buying opportunity , " they added .
Piper Jaffray analysts , led by Michael Olson , maintained their overweight rating for Netflix and kept their $ 420 price target , saying in a Tuesday note that " the long - term potential is too great for us to suggest anything other than buying Netflix on todays weakness . "

Such misses have happened before with Netflix , wrote Olson , citing a second - quarter shortfall in 2016 and echoing what Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said on Monday during the company 's earnings interview .
But that was followed by " a solid upside in the third quarter ( and beyond ) , " he wrote , adding : " Netflix has faced hurdles before and this second - quarter report wo nt be the last . "

We believe this is a speed bump rather than the start of a negative subscription trend for Netflix as the streaming market and content arms race continues to be a major tailwind for the company over the next 12 to 18 months , " Ives wrote .
At least eight analysts raised their price targets for Netflix on Tuesday , while 13 lowered their targets and eight made no changes .
At least two analysts upgraded their ratings for the streaming company , while two downgraded them and 28 kept them the same

Warren Buffett famously still lives in the Omaha , Nebraska , home he bought in 1958 for $ 31,000 . (
Now its property taxes are almost that much . )
But at the urging of his late wife , Susie , Buffett also bought a beachfront vacation home in Laguna Beach , California , in 1971 for $ 150,000 .
While Buffett put the mansion on the market for $ 11 million in February 2017 , the home has not yet been sold -- and Buffett has n't budged on the price .
In fact , the house has been on the market for almost five months longer than the median listing time for listings in the same price range in the same ZIP code , Bloomberg reports .
While the home might be overpriced , at least according to some Realtors , the beachside estate is still a beauty .
Buffett 's 3,600-square - foot Emerald Bay house is just steps from the Pacific Ocean , according to listing agent Bill Dolby with Villa Real Estate .
It has six bedrooms , seven bathrooms and several balconies with epic views ( seen below ) .
Warren Buffett has given away $ 3.4 billion in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.A , -0.29 % BRK.B , -0.61 % stock , the company said late Monday .

WASHINGTON - An international lobbying firm announced the hiring of convicted former national security adviser Michael Flynn Tuesday , even as the retired Army lieutenant general awaited sentencing for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia .
Yet hours after the move was made public by the newly - constituted Stonington Global LLC - on the same day that Flynn appeared in federal court to discuss an expedited sentencing schedule - Flynn 's attorneys said the timing of the hiring announcement appeared to be premature . "
Gen. Flynn has not joined Stonington and did not personally issue any public statement , " attorneys Robert Kelner and Stephen Anthony said in a joint statement late Tuesday . "
He ( Flynn ) was aware that a statement was being drafted , but he did not intend that it be issued at this time .
Its issuance now in his name appears to have been the result of a misunderstanding . "
Indeed , the Stonington statement , issued by founding partners Nick Muzin and Joey Allaham , included a detailed description of Flynn 's new duties as director of global strategy and comments " provided " by the retired general who said he was " excited to begin this new phase of my career . "
Flynn , who had been one of President Donald Trump 's most vocal surrogates in his 2016 campaign , spent just over three weeks as national security adviser before fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia .
Asked about the statement from Flynn 's attorneys , Muzin said he was unable to comment on the general 's " considerations about the timing of the announcement " but still looked forward to " working together . "
The confusing nature of Flynn 's status only raised more questions about the international firm 's interest in Flynn .
Muzin and Allaham did not comment on Flynn 's unresolved legal status nor on his dismissal from the White House last year . "
We are proud to welcome Gen. Flynn to our firm and are delighted to be able to draw on his years of military and national security experience to better serve our clients , " Muzin said in the initial statement .
He later referred to the company 's representation of the state of Qatar and the successful efforts to broker an Oval Office meeting for Qatari government officials .
Flynn 's hiring was first reported earlier Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal .
Tuesday 's court hearing and its consideration of a sentencing schedule , meanwhile , signaled that Flynn was wrapping up his cooperation agreement with the government .
Eager to move on It was Flynn 's first court appearance since December when he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak .
The general did not speak , but Kelner said his client is " eager " to move on with his life .
As part of his agreement to plead guilty , Flynn had pledged to assist Mueller 's prosecutors in the ongoing investigation into Russia 's interference in the 2016 election .
Flynn 's cooperation is nearing an end at a potentially key juncture in the Russia inquiry , with President Donald Trump 's lawyers still sparring over whether they will submit to an interview with Mueller 's team and as Trump 's former personal attorney , Michael Cohen , weighs whether he will cooperate with federal prosecutors investigating his business dealings in a separate federal inquiry .
If Cohen agrees to cooperate , whatever relevant information he could provide would likely be shared with Mueller 's team .
Sentencing considerations for Flynn also come as the government prepares for two trials involving former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort .
Manafort sits in a Virginia jail cell awaiting his first trial later this month on bank and tax fraud charges .
A related trial has been set in the District of Columbia in September on money laundering charges .
It was not immediately clear from Tuesday 's brief hearing before U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan what continuing obligation remained for Flynn before a sentencing hearing could be scheduled in the case . "
General Flynn very much wants to bring this chapter to ( an ) end , " Kelner told Sullivan , as he sought to expedite a required pre - sentence report by federal probation officers in advance of any hearing .
Sullivan said he would consider such a move next month if Flynn had finished his work for Mueller 's team .
Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents , claiming that he did not ask Kislyak to delay a vote on a pending United Nations Security Council resolution critical of Israeli settlements .
Prosecutors also asserted that Flynn lied to agents about a Dec. 29 , 2016 conversation about how Russia might respond to sanctions the U.S. government had levied over its election meddling .
President Obama imposed those sanctions Dec. 28 ; the same day , Kislyak contacted Flynn to discuss how the Russian government would respond .
Flynn arrived at the courthouse Tuesday morning with his wife , Lori , where small groups of rival protesters waved signs and shouted both words of encouragement and derision at the former general .
Some revived a variation of the same chant Flynn led two years ago at the Republican National Convention when he referred to then - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . "
Lock him up ! "
some shouted as Flynn 's group walked to a waiting car and drove away .
WASHINGTON - FBI Agent Peter Strzok , who exchanged anti - Trump text messages with his co - worker girlfriend , said Thursday that his political beliefs never affected his work on the Russia or Hillary Clinton investigations . "
Let me be clear , unequivocally and under oath : Not once in my 26 years of defending our nation did my personal opinions impact any official action I took , " Strzok testified before two House committees . "
This is true for the Clinton email investigation , for the investigation into Russian interference and for every other investigation I ve worked on , " Strzok said in a chamber packed with a standing - room - only crowd . "
It is not who I am , and it is not something I would ever do .
Period . "
Strzok helped lead the investigations into Russia 's interference in the 2016 presidential election and into Clinton 's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state .
He was removed from the Russia inquiry by special counsel Robert Mueller last summer when Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz discovered texts between Strzok and former FBI attorney Lisa Page disparaging then - candidate Donald Trump in 2016 .
Republicans used Thursday 's hearing to underscore their charges of bias by the FBI and Department of Justice against Trump and in favor of Clinton .
Strzok denied that he was part of any conspiracy to go after Trump , and Democrats backed him .
Democrats charged that Republicans were trying to undermine Mueller 's investigation of possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign .
Republicans want Mueller 's inquiry to end before the midterm elections in November .
Democrats say Mueller should not be pressured to end his investigation prematurely .
Strzok said he never revealed information about the Russia investigation that could have damaged Trump 's campaign . "
There is ... one extraordinarily important piece of evidence supporting my integrity , the integrity of the FBI and our lack of bias , " Strzok said . "
In the summer of 2016 , I was one of a handful of people who knew the details of Russian election interference and its possible connections with members of the Trump campaign .
This information had the potential to derail , and quite possibly defeat , Mr. Trump .
But the thought of exposing that information never crossed my mind . " '
Hostile questioning Strzok faced hostile Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , who pointed to his text messages with Page in 2015 and 2016 as evidence of bias in the Russia and Clinton investigations .
Strzok and Page were having an extramarital affair at the time they were texting .
Rep. Louie Gohmert , R - Texas , brought up the affair during one of the most heated parts of the hearing , asking Strzok whether he gave his wife the same " innocent " look he was giving Congress members .
Democrats shouted Gohmert down as Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman , D - N.J. , yelled " you need your medication . "
Strzok angrily replied that Gohmert 's question " goes more to a discussion about your character . " "
The fact that you would question whether or not that was the sort of look I would engage with at a family member that I have acknowledged hurting goes more to a discussion about your character and what you stand for and what is going on inside you , " Strzok said .
Strzok said he criticized Clinton , Sen. Bernie Sanders , I - Vt . ,
and others in the text messages as well as Trump .
In response to a question from Rep. Steve Chabot , R - Ohio , Strzok conceded that it was " fair to say " that he and Page detested Trump and supported Clinton .
He acknowledged that his testimony was unlikely to satisfy his critics . "
After all , Americans are skeptical of anything coming out of Washington , " Strzok said . "
But the fact is , after months of investigations , there is simply no evidence of bias in my professional actions . "
Strzok was subpoenaed last week by the House Judiciary Committee to testify publicly about the text messages he exchanged with Page .
In a report to Congress released last month , Horowitz said Page wrote to Strzok in a text message , " ( Trump 's ) not ever going to become president , right ? "
In response , Strzok wrote , " No .
No he 's not .
We 'll stop it . "
Angry about Khan treatment Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy , R - S.C. , pressed Strzok to explain that exchange Thursday .
Strzok said he wrote the text " late at night , off the cuff . "
He said he was angry that candidate Trump " insulted " the family of Humayun Khan , a Muslim American soldier killed by a suicide bomber in Iraq .
Khan 's father , Khizr , criticized Trump 's proposed ban on Muslim immigrants at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 .
Trump responded by questioning whether Khizr Khans wife , Ghazala , was allowed to speak on stage as a Muslim woman .
Strzok said he thought Trump 's behavior was " horrible and disgusting " and he believed Americans would reject the candidate because of it . "
It was in no way that me or the FBI would take any action to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate , " Strzok said of his text message .
In his report , Horowitz found no evidence that the FBI or DOJ were motivated by political bias in deciding not to prosecute Clinton for using a private email server to send and receive sensitive information .
The report said Strzok repeatedly pushed for more aggressive action in the Clinton investigation .
Page has left the bureau .
Strzok is still employed with the FBI but was escorted from FBI headquarters in June , so his personnel case could be reviewed .
He is the FBI 's deputy assistant director in the Human Relations Department .
He previously served as deputy assistant director of the counterintelligence division .
Page agrees to testify The same committees questioning Strzok subpoenaed Page and threatened her with contempt of Congress when she declined to testify in a closed hearing Wednesday .
After Thursday 's hearing began , Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte , R - Va . ,
announced that the committee had reached an agreement with Page for her to be interviewed by lawmakers Friday and Monday in closed sessions .
There will be a transcript of her testimony , but Goodlatte did not say whether that transcript would be made public .
Strzok answered 11 hours of questions from committee members during a closed hearing late last month , and he was angered by selective leaks of his testimony by lawmakers .
Strzok was on Trump 's mind Wednesday night while the president was in Brussels for a NATO meeting . "
How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started , influenced and worked on , for an extended period of time , by former FBI Agent / Lover Peter Strzok ? "
Trump tweeted . "
Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear ! "
Strzok said Russian interference in the 2016 election " was a grave attack on our democracy " and not a " witch hunt " as Trump has repeatedly alleged . "
Most disturbingly , it has been wildly successful - sowing discord in our nation and shaking faith in our institutions , " Strzok said .
" I have the utmost respect for Congresss oversight role , but I truly believe that todays hearing is just another victory notch in ( Russian President Vladimir ) Putins belt and another milestone in our enemies campaign to tear America apart . "
He said it is " profoundly painful to watch and even worse to play a part in . "
WASHINGTON - Federal prosecutors offered some tantalizing reasons Wednesday for what prompted attorneys for former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort to raise late objections this week to moving their client from a rural Virginia jail cell to the Alexandria Detention Center ahead of his upcoming trial on tax and bank fraud charges .
In court documents , prosecutors working for Russia special counsel Robert Mueller , said Manafort - long accustomed to a life of luxury cars , tailored suits and multiple residences on the outside - has been afforded " unique privileges ' ' inside the Northern Neck Regional Jail near Richmond , where he has been confined since a federal judge revoked his bail last month . "
Manafort enjoys ... a private , self contained living unit , his own bathroom and shower facility , his own personal telephone and his own work - space to prepare for trial , " prosecutors wrote in opposition to a defense request to postpone the July 25 trial .
In a series of monitored telephone calls , described by prosecutors in court documents , Manafort also has told associates that he is not required to wear a prison uniform and " has mentioned that he is being treated like a VIP . "
Defense attorneys , in part , based their request for a trial delay on a lack of proximity to their client , whose Warsaw , Va. , jail cell is located about 100 miles from the site of his upcoming trial in Alexandria .
They said the distance made it difficult for Manafort to engage in a timely review of necessary documents in advance of the trial .
But prosecutors , again citing Manafort 's monitored telephone conversations and phone logs , said the former campaign aide to President Donald Trump has participated in more than 100 calls with his attorneys and has completed a review of documents provided by the government . "
Telephone logs indicate Manafort has spoken to his attorneys every day , and often multiple times a day , " prosecutors said . "
Manafort also possess a personal laptop that he is permitted to use in his ( jail ) unit to review materials and prepare for trial .
The jail has made extra accommodations for Manafort 's use of the laptop , including providing him an extension cord to ensure the laptop can be used in his unit and not just in the separate workroom . "
In a monitored July 4 call to an undisclosed party , according to prosecutors , Manafort said that he had " all my files like I would at home . "
Acting on the initial defense request for the trial delay , U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis Wednesday issued an order for Manafort 's transfer to Alexandria , dismissing the attorneys ' late objection that such a move could pose a risk to their client 's safety .
With the move , the judge also strongly hinted that the quality of Manafort 's accommodations were about to dramatically change . "
Defense counsel has not identified any general or specific threat to defendant 's safety at the Alexandria Detention Center , " Ellis wrote Wednesday . "
They have not done so , because the professionals at the Alexandria Detention Center are very familiar with housing high - profile defendants , including foreign and domestic terrorists , spies and traitors . "
All of those defendants were housed safely in Alexandria pending their respective trials and defendant 's experience ... will presumably be no different , " he said .
WASHINGTON - In 2005 , Lt .
Gen. Jim Mattis had advice on militarizing space for the future defense secretary : Be ready to rocket Marines around the globe to hot spots in two hours or less .
Now that he is defense secretary , Mattis has been charged by President Donald Trump with creating a sixth armed service , the Space Force .
Mattis can look to the advice from his younger self contained in documents he signed as commander of the Marine Corps Deputy Commandant for Combat Development .
They contained a wish list of capabilities the Marine Corps wanted for combat anywhere on the planet on short notice .
The request to fund the Small Unit Transport and Insertion Capability , essentially rocketing a 13-man squad into action , is tucked into the documents with more immediate concerns of the time , including protecting Marines from roadside bombs in Iraq .
The SUSTAIN request revived concepts that have rattled around the halls of the Pentagon in the decades since space travel and satellites became commonplace .
Military planners have asserted the need to dominate space where satellites , vulnerable to attack , guide everything from small units on the ground to precision - guided bombs to their targets .
Trump echoed those concerns in calling for a separate military branch responsible for space . "
It is not enough to merely have an American presence in space , we must have American dominance in space , " Trump said last month . "
Very importantly , I 'm hereby directing the Department of Defense and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a space force as the sixth branch of the armed forces .
That is a big statement . "
Mattis initially resisted the idea of a separate service for space , writing to Congress last year that it would " likely present a narrower and even parochial approach to space operations . "
Military analysts such as Michael OHanlon of the Brookings Institution argued that the force would probably be derived largely from the Air Force , creating two weaker organizations .
By Aug. 1 , the Pentagon will submit a plan to Congress on how it plans to organize its approach to space .
An interim report released in March noted that the U.S. military has held an advantage in space , but rivals Russia and China are catching up .
Dana White , the top Pentagon spokeswoman , said the military understands Trump 's guidance and will work with Congress to address it .
The new service would require congressional action , and Sen. Bill Nelson , D - Fla . ,
on the Armed Services Committee is skeptical .
He tweeted last month that " now is NOT the time to rip the Air Force apart . " "
The Space Force concept is premature and will probably disrupt progress the Pentagon has been making in space , " said Loren Thompson , a defense and aviation analyst with the Washington - based Lexington Institute .
Mattis and other senior officials softened their opposition to Trumps proposal , and the Pentagon is studying the possibility of creating a separate service .
Mattis , who had no immediate comment to USA TODAY about his earlier plans , could dust off the urgent need plea from the Marine Corps in 2002 that informed his recommendation in 2005 for SUSTAIN , which envisioned the capability to " transport small , mission - tailored units through space from any point on the globe " within minutes of the president 's order .
The Marines have long sought to pioneer space fighting .
In 1963 , Marine Gen. Wallace Greene said spaceflight could have a " staggering " impact on projecting U.S. power .
Greene , later the Marine Corps commandant , wanted Marines in space by 1968 .
The Universal Need Statement envisioned a stealthy rocketship carrying 13 Marines that could loiter in low - Earth orbit and snuff out the spark of a threat before it blazed .
Critics noted that rocketing troops into space , landing them and extracting them would require enormous amounts of fuel and the lightest ship possible for efficiency .
That would eliminate armor , leaving the ship vulnerable to attack .
It 's unclear what tasks the 13 troops with small arms could accomplish or how they would leave the places they had rocketed into . "
There are no imperial battle cruisers in the Pentagon 's space posture , just a collection of highly vulnerable satellites , " Thompson said . "
The Space Force proposal will get in the way of making them more resilient . "
The president 's timing on proposing a Space Force is odd , " he said . "
The Air Force is devoting more of its money and intellectual capital to space today than ever before .
It certainly is n't neglecting space . "
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump fired another shot in an ongoing trade war with China on Tuesday , as his administration released a list of $ 200 billion in Chinese goods subject to 10 percent tariffs . "
This is an appropriate response under the authority of Section 301 to obtain the elimination of Chinas harmful industrial policies , " said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , claiming that Chinese trade policies represent a national security threat to the United States .
China , which has denied U.S. accusations of unfair trade policies , has retaliated against previous tariffs with levies on U.S. goods , and can be expected to do so again .
The proposed tariff list that President Trump ordered last month ranges from Chinese air conditioners to leather goods .
The proposed tariffs do not go into effect immediately , but will undergo a two - month review process as officials from both countries negotiate settlements to their trade disputes .

More : China 's tariffs will hit farm states hard , spare service - heavy states Opposition to the proposed new tariffs came from both Republicans and Democrats , as well as American businesses that stand to be negatively impacted .
Sen. Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , said in a statement that although he " supported the administration 's targeted effort to combat China 's technology transfer regime , " the latest move " appears reckless and is not a targeted approach . "
The Senate Finance Committee chairman added that " this action falls short of a strategy that will give the administration negotiating leverage with China . "
Sen. Jeff Flake , R - Ariz . ,
said " finally " the Senate will " push back on the President 's abuse " of his power to impose tariffs .
Flake said in a tweet that the Senate plans to vote Wednesday on a " motion to instruct , " which he called a " first step toward reasserting Congresss constitutional role on tariffs " The American Apparel & Footwear Association said Trump 's move would negatively impact consumers in the U.S. " The administration has shown that it is not concerned about targeting the American public with its ' Trump Tax . ' "
said AAFA president and CEO Rick Helfenbein in a statement . "
This will result in inflationary costs throughout the supply chain , ultimately paid for by American consumers . "
Retail Industry Leaders Association vice president of international trade Hun Quach said in a statement that , " The President has broken his promise to bring ' maximum pain on China , minimum pain on consumers , ' and American families are the ones being punished .
Consumers , businesses and the American jobs dependent on trade , are left in the crosshairs of an escalating global trade war . "

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump 's selection of Brett Kavanaugh on Monday as his Supreme Court nominee capped days of leaks , tea - leaf reading and rumors that surfaced as the president deliberated over an ever - shortening list candidates .
An intense battle unfolded behind the scenes for the coveted Supreme Court seat to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy , mostly centering on the strengths and weaknesses of the frontrunner , Kavanaugh .
Various advisers to Trump , both inside and outside the White House , were giving the president conflicting advice on Kavanaugh and the other three appeals court judges who ended up on the final short list : Amy Coney Barrett of Indiana , Raymond Kethledge of Michigan , and Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania .
Through it all , Kavanaugh remained the favorite , said Trump administration officials and outside advisers who consulted with the White House on the search .
More : Brett Kavanaugh is President Trump 's nominee for the Supreme Court More : For President Trump , Supreme Court nomination may hinge on Brett Kavanaugh 's risks and rewards Kavanaugh , a Washington , D.C.-based appeals judge , had the support of prominent legal advisers , including White House Counsel Don McGahn - as well as Justice Kennedy , who spoke highly of his former clerk , according to the sources , who spoke to USA Today on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations .
Media coverage of the jockeying over the court pick raised the profiles of Kavanaugh 's other three rivals , and one outside adviser said the final selection became " a real jump ball " at different points .
White House officials said Trump seriously considered all the contenders . "
The president had a very deliberative process , " counselor Kellyanne Conway said after the Kavanaugh ceremony .
Intentionally or not , the Trump administration sowed uncertainty by asking all four finalists to prepare for Monday 's prime - time ceremony .
Guest lists , speeches All were asked to prepare remarks for Trump 's big event , advisers said .
They were also asked to provide lists of guests they would invite to the White House - requests that apparently led some supporters to believe their favored candidate would be the nominee .
Trump liked Hardiman 's up - by - the - bootstraps life story , including the fact that he put himself through law school by driving a cab .
He saw Kethledge as erudite and it also helped that he was from the politically important state of Michigan .
Trump liked the fact that Barrett had strong support from religious conservatives and was intrigued by the possibility of nominating a woman .
The anti - Kavanaugh candidates also had drawbacks , advisers said : Barrett has been an appeals judge for less than a year .
Some conservatives questioned Kethledge 's record in immigration cases .
Others questioned whether Hardiman was conservative enough .
Trump also heard from critics of Kavanaugh , many of whom cited his work in the George W. Bush administration and played on the president 's antipathy to the Bush family .
The Bush factor did not play a large role in Trump 's thinking , advisers said , as the president considered Kavanaugh 's record in total .
That record included more than 300 written opinions , many of them in support of one of Trump 's favorite causes : deregulation .
Trump was also impressed with Kavanaugh 's academic credentials : he is a graduate of Yale and Yale Law School .
Justice Kennedy 's high regard for Kavanaugh also helped Trump decide , advisers said .
Trump went back and forth on the merits of the four finalists before zeroing in on Kavanaugh as he spent last weekend at his golf club in New Jersey .
On Sunday , after he returned from Bedminster , N.J. , Trump invited Kavanaugh to the White House for a final talk and offered him the job later that night .
After that , Trump told McGahn and Vice President Mike Pence .
Trump notified Justice Kennedy about the selection Monday morning even as many White House officials remained in the dark .
Keeping it secret By that time , the game was more about keeping the Kavanaugh pick a secret than about the pick itself .
Many advisers believed it was still a two - man race between Kavanaugh and Hardiman .
Only by midday did aides say Trump had made his final selection .
Hardiman was scheduled to be in Washington to attend a judicial conference on Monday , spurring speculation he might go to a White House ceremony afterward .
Barrett and Kethledge , meanwhile , were assumed to be out of the running when it became clear they were in their homes in Indiana and Michigan .
Even many of the White House aides who worked on the planning for Monday 's ceremony did not know for certain Kavanaugh was the pick until the final hour before the event .
Minutes before Trump took the stage in the ornate White House East Room , the news finally began to leak out .
Seeking to maintain the suspense , Trump kept the guest of honor and his family off stage as he made introductory remarks before announcing the pick : " Tonight it is my honor and privilege to announce that I will nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court . "
WASHINGTON - Secret donors financed more than four out of every 10 television ads that outside groups broadcast this year to influence Novembers high - stakes congressional elections , according to a USA TODAY analysis of Kantar Media data .
Leading the way : organizations affiliated with billionaire industrialist Charles Koch , whose conservative donor network plows hundreds of millions of dollars into politics and policy debates each election cycle .
Two Koch - affiliated groups account for more than one - quarter of the House and Senate advertising from groups that do nt disclose their donors , according to a tally of broadcast ads tracked by Kantar Medias Campaign Media Analysis Group .
Those Koch advocacy groups , Americans for Prosperity and Concerned Veterans for America , have trained their advertising fire on five Democratic senators up for re - election from red and purple states : Sens .
Joe Donnelly of Indiana , Claire McCaskill of Missouri , Jon Tester of Montana , Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin .
The spending is about to soar even higher as Novembers general election draws closer and the ad war intensifies over President Donald Trumps Supreme Court pick , Brett Kavanaugh .
Americans for Prosperity announced that week that it would spend at least $ 1 million on paid advertising and voter outreach in the Supreme Court confirmation fight , much of it to pressure vulnerable Democratic senators on Kavanaugh .
In all , nearly 386,000 television spots focused on House and Senate races have aired from Jan. 1 to July 8 this year , ranging from ads by candidates to those funded by outside groups .
That total surpasses the 355,464 broadcast TV spots that ran at the same point in the last midterm elections for Congress in 2014 and underscores the battle raging for control of Congress .
Advertising from secret - money groups has jumped , too .
A recent analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project and the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics found a 26 percent increase in airings by " dark money " groups in federal races since the 2014 midterms .
These organizations generally operate as nonprofit advocacy groups or trade associations that do not have politics as their main purpose .
Many of their commercials count as " issue ads " and are not reported to federal election regulators because they do not specifically call for the election or defeat of candidates .
But their growing role means voters know less about the interests trying to influence elections and Congress , said Robert Maguire , who tracks politically active nonprofits at the Center for Responsive Politics . "
We should know if a particular energy bill is going to be a sweetheart deal for an energy donor , " Maguire said .
Outside groups ran nearly 107,000 of the broadcast ads in House and Senate races this year .
Organizations identified by USA TODAY as nondisclosing accounted for nearly 47,000 of those ads , nearly 44 percent .
Conservative - leaning groups account for four out of the five biggest secret - money advertisers .
Koch officials did not respond to requests for comment about their advertising .
But they have made no secret of their intention to spend heavily in Senate and House races , where Democrats need to flip just 23 GOP seats to seize control of the chamber .
Koch operatives also have fought aggressively against efforts to unmask donors , saying disclosing that information could subject contributors to threats and chill free speech .

But she joined all of her fellow Democrats in opposing the tax bill Trump signed into law last December .
In one Americans for Prosperity ad targeting McCaskills " no " vote , a woman touts the $ 2,000 bonus she received from her company as a result of the tax cuts and said McCaskill " let Missouri families down . "
In response , McCaskill spokeswoman Meira Bernstein called the tax package a " windfall " for big business and said " no amount of dark money ... will stop Claire from speaking out about it . "
Kantars data show about 42 percent of all the advertising in the Missouri Senate race - which pits McCaskill against the Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley - has come from groups that do not publicly disclose their donors .
The proportion is even higher in Wisconsin - 46 percent - where Baldwin , a liberal Democrat , is trying to win a second term in a swing state Trump won by less than 1 percent .
The Koch - affiliated Concerned Veterans for America has led the ad blitz against Baldwin , running the most commercials of any outside group in that race , the Kantar tally shows .
A commercial the group launched this week says Baldwin missed more than 70 percent of " important meetings " of a Senate Homeland Security panel .
Earlier ads criticized her handling of a prescription drug scandal at Wisconsins Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center .
The No .
2 outside group active in Baldwins race : Vote Vets Action Fund , a liberal group with union ties that does not disclose its donors , either . "
Why are we doing $ 2.5 million in Wisconsin to help Tammy Baldwin ? "
Vote Vets chief Jon Soltz said . "
Because the Koch brothers are financing a group to attack Tammy Baldwin on veterans issues .
And we know that Tammy Baldwin has been great on veterans issues . "
Vote Vets ads tout Baldwins work since the Tomah scandal to toughen opioid prescription guidelines .
Soltz said his group complies with the law and operates under the same rules as conservative organizations .
And because it does not have the file monthly or quarterly reports with the Federal Election Commission , detailing its contributions and spending , Vote Vets Action Fund can grow its staff , conduct polling and switch strategy " without our opponents seeing how we are spending our money ... or what issues we 're working on , " he said . "
We use the vehicles that are available to us , " Soltz added . "
Right now , the law is the law , and we play within the boundaries of it . "
WASHINGTON - Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh argued in 1998 that President Bill Clinton could be impeached for lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
For much of the next decade he worked inside the White House for President George W. Bush , where he came to the conclusion that " the job of president is far more difficult than any other civilian position in government . "
Thus it was that in 2009 , after Barack Obama won the presidency , he suggested that presidents should be immune from criminal investigations and prosecutions , as well as personal civil suits , until after leaving office . "
I believe it vital that the president be able to focus on his never - ending tasks with as few distractions as possible , " he wrote .
Kavanaugh 's evolving views on executive power through the past three presidencies are supported by mainstream conservatives today .
But they are viewed with suspicion by some who believe the presidency has grown more powerful than the framers of the Constitution intended .
And Democrats are concerned that President Donald Trump 's nomination of Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court is a reward for his espousal of presidential powers .
Should he win confirmation , some of them say , he should recuse himself from cases involving Trump . "
The president of the United States should not be above the law .
The president of the United States should not be beyond a criminal investigation , " said Sen. Cory Booker , D - N.J. " The president of the United States should not be able to pick the judge that will preside over questions involving his investigation . "
While Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has said the focus of his party 's effort to defeat Kavanaugh will be the judge 's views on abortion and health care , his position on executive power is quickly emerging as a third front in the confirmation war .
More : Will Brett Kavanaugh deliver the change conservatives crave ?
More : Brett Kavanaugh is President Trump 's nominee for the Supreme Court More : For Trump , nomination may hinge on Kavanaugh 's risks and rewards Like many conservatives , including most of those on the Supreme Court , Kavanaugh objects to one form of executive branch power : that exercised by federal regulators and , in particular , independent agencies .
He is wary of green - lighting most agency rules under a 1984 Supreme Court decision , a process that has come to be known as " Chevron deference . "
Just this year , Kavanaugh dissented from a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling that upheld the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , an independent agency created by Congress in 2010 in the wake of the financial crisis on Wall Street .
He called such agencies " a headless fourth branch of the U.S. Government " that " hold enormous power over the economic and social life of the United States . "
Protecting the president For a primary author of independent counsel Kenneth Starr 's occasionally explicit report detailing Clinton 's transgressions , Kavanaugh traveled a long way to his 2009 article in the Minnesota Law Review recommending that presidents be free from prosecution . "
This is not something I necessarily thought in the 1980s or 1990s , " he wrote .
But " looking back to the late 1990s , for example , the nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal - investigation offshoots . "
Kavanaugh did not suggest that judges treat presidents differently , however .
He said Congress should pass a law providing that civil suits and criminal investigations be deferred while the president is in office .
If the president acts " dastardly , " he said , " the impeachment process is available . "
The law review article - which also included recommendations for making agencies more accountable to the president and , interestingly , streamlining the judicial confirmation process - is certain to be a focus when Kavanaugh goes before the Senate Judiciary Committee later this summer or fall .
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who supervised Kavanaugh in the White House counsel 's office , said the nominee is " probably right " that a sitting president should be immune from indictment and prosecution while in office . "
If appointed and this issue were to come before the court , I think it likely Brett would recuse on this issue , " Gonzales said . '
Enormous concentration of power ' In hundreds of opinions and dissents at the powerful appeals court , Kavanaugh has backed the president 's national security powers and has defended the use of military tribunals for terrorism suspects . "
Especially on national - security - related areas , he is likely to be with the more pro - executive power folks on the current court , " said Jonathan Adler , an expert on administrative law at Case Western Reserve University School of Law .
That would not represent much of a change at the high court , where conservative justices usually support the president on matters involving national security .
Just last month , the court ruled 5 - 4 - with retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority - that Trump acted legally and constitutionally in banning travelers from five predominantly Muslim nations .
On domestic issues , Kavanaugh often rules against federal agencies seeking to regulate commerce and industry .
A recent example was his 2017 dissent from the appeals court 's decision not to hear a challenge to the government 's " net neutrality " rule , which sought to block internet service providers from offering faster access to some customers .
The Federal Communications Commission reversed the rule this year .
His support for a " unitary executive " model of government , in which the president wields more power , worries some conservatives in an era when those powers have expanded to areas such as immigration and the war on drugs . "
Such an enormous concentration of power is dangerous , " says Ilya Somin , a law professor at George Mason University 's Antonin Scalia Law School . "
It enables one person to dictate how all kinds of things are regulated and controlled . "

WASHINGTON - The European Union will impose import tariff quotas of 25 % on a number of steel products Thursday to protect the European market from the effects of the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum , the European Commission announced Wednesday .
The provisional safeguard measures - imposed against all countries outside the EU - cover 23 steel product categories .
For each of the categories , tariffs of 25 % will be levied only after imports exceed the average of the last three years .
The Commission is resorting to retaliatory tariffs to avoid a sudden increase of imports that would hurt European steelmakers . "
The U.S. tariffs on steel products are causing trade diversion , which may result in serious harm to EU steelmakers and workers in this industry , " said EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom . "
These measures nevertheless ensure that the EU market remains open and will maintain traditional trade flows . "
As a result of the import duties applied in June by the United States under Section 232 of the U.S. Trade Expansion Act - 25 % on imported steel and 10 % on aluminum - exporting steel to the U.S. has become less attractive , and steel suppliers have diverted some of their exports to Europe .
Related : Trade - war tracker : Here are the new levies , imposed and threatened The steel sector represents a vital industry for the European Unions economy , providing jobs for hundreds of thousands of European citizens .
In 2016 , the global surplus in steelmaking capacity reached a record 737 million metric tons .
This has depressed steel prices , damaging the steel sector and related industries .
Under the World Trade Organizations rules for the application of safeguard measures , provisional measures may be imposed when " there is clear evidence that increased imports have caused or threaten to cause serious injury . "
Such measures should be in the form of refundable tariff increases , and may be kept in place for a maximum of 200 days .
The measures are part of a three - pronged response against U.S. tariffs .
The EU already imposed 10 % to 25 % duties on $ 3.2 billion in U.S. imports on June 22 , and will be imposing 10 % to 50 % additional levies on $ 4.2 billion in U.S. imports in 2021 .

WASHINGTON - The Secret Service urges U.S. schools to establish teams that can assess threats and prevent shootings like the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida , that left 17 people dead .
In a report unveiled Thursday , the Secret Service offers schools guidance on spotting suspicious behavior and figuring out when and how to intervene .
The report was prepared by the National Threat Assessment Center in an effort launched after the Parkland shooting Feb. 14 .
The report recommends forming " threat teams " drawn from the ranks of teachers , coaches , guidance counselors , mental health authorities and law enforcement to manage central reporting systems within the schools .
The teams would be tasked with flagging troubling conduct , from threatening social media posts to information about students ' access to weapons . "
The threshold for intervention should be relatively low so that teams can identify students in distress before their behavior escalates to the point that classmates , teachers , or parents are concerned about their safety or the safety of others , " the report concludes .
The 17-page document builds on agency research this year focusing on suspects linked to violence in schools and other public places .
It says 64 percent of attackers showed symptoms of mental illness .
In 25 percent of the cases , attackers had been " hospitalized or prescribed psychiatric medications " before the assaults .
In the Parkland case , which has driven a vocal national debate on gun safety , social workers , mental health counselors , school officials and law enforcement were all warned about Nikolas Cruz 's deteriorating mental state and risk of violence before he allegedly attacked .
Cruz , 19 , is charged with 17 counts of murder ; prosecutors seek the death penalty .
The Parkland shooting prompted the state to enact safety measures , including a mandate for individual schools to create threat teams similar to those urged by the Secret Service .
According to the Florida Department of Education , the teams would be permitted access to suspects ' criminal histories .
Florida school team leaders would be required to report identified threats to administrators and the suspects ' parents or guardians .
Lina Alathari , chief of the Secret Service 's National Threat Assessment Center , said educators have been moving to create such teams since the attack in 2012 at a Newtown , Connecticut , elementary school that left 26 dead .
After that assault , a survey of safety plans at 227 schools found that about 70 percent had some form of threat assessment program . "
There are some schools that have nothing , " Alathari said , adding that there have been no uniform standards for evaluating threats at schools . "
It 's up to the schools and the ( school ) districts to allocate resources . "
Even if schools take steps to establish threat teams , Secret Service Director Randolph " Tex " Alles cautioned , attackers do not fit a common profile . "
These acts of violence were committed by students who were loners and socially isolated and those who were well - liked and popular , " Alles said in the report . "
Rather than focusing solely on a students personality traits or school performance , we can learn much more about a students risk for violence by working through the threat assessment process . "
WASHINGTON - There is no evidence so far that Russian hackers are mounting the kind of " robust " attacks on state election systems this year that they did in 2016 , a top homeland security official told a House panel Wednesday . "
The 2018 midterms remain a potential target for Russian actors , " said Christopher Krebs , under secretary of the national protection and programs directorate at the Department of Homeland Security . "
But the intelligence community has yet to see any evidence of a robust campaign aimed at tampering with our election infrastructure along the lines of 2016 or influencing the makeup of the House or Senate races . , "
Krebs told the House Homeland Security Committee at a hearing on election security .
In 2016 , Russian hackers tried to breach election systems in at least 21 states , according to homeland security officials .
Although no actual votes were changed , hackers broke into Illinois ' voter registration database and stole some information .
Krebs said it 's likely that the hackers actually scanned the election systems of all 50 states for vulnerabilities .
Russia also mounted a major effort in 2016 to influence the U.S. election through the use of social media on Facebook , Twitter and Google .
Russian troll farms created fake social media accounts and websites to try to sow dissent among Americans on divisive issues such as race , gay rights , gun control , and religion .
USA TODAY NETWORK reporters in May reviewed each of the 3,517 Facebook ads created by the Russia - based Internet Research Agency and found that most of them focused on racial issues .
Krebs told lawmakers that the Russians are at it again this year .
The intelligence community sees the Russians using social media " to influence or inflame positions on opposite ends of controversial issues , " Krebs said . "
These efforts seem to be more focused on dividing rather than on targeting specific politicians or political candidates .
Nonetheless , we remain vigilant and any attempt to undermine our democracy will be met with consequences . "
State election and homeland security officials will meet in Philadelphia this week to keep cooperating on how to fix the cyber security of state elections systems , Krebs said .
State election systems include vote tabulation systems as well as voter registration databases .
So far , the Department of Homeland Security has completed risk and vulnerability assessments on election systems in 17 states to help local officials find and correct problems , Krebs said .
The Russians will target the congressional midterm elections this November , said Rep. Michael McCaul , R - Texas , the committee chairman . "
We need to be prepared , " he said .
President Trump 's behavior , most recently Wednesday in Brussels , is making Krebs ' job harder , said Bennie Thompson of Mississippi , the committee 's top Democrat .
Trump accused Germany of being " totally controlled by Russia " and of not meeting its NATO obligations . "
Germany , as far I m concerned , is captive to Russia , " Trump said .
The president is preparing to meet next week with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to improve U.S.-Russian relations . "
Instead of working with our European allies to confront Russia --a shared adversary whose attempts to undermine Western democratic institutions are growing more and more bold -- [ Trump ] is trolling them to curry favor with Russian President Vladimir Putin . "
Thompson said .
Thompson also expressed doubts about whether Trump will confront Putin about Russia 's 2016 election meddling , which Putin has repeatedly denied . "
President Trump has said he will address Russias 2016 election meddling in a meeting with Putin , but he has never demonstrated a credible ability to confront Putin with our Intelligence Communitys findings , " Thompson said . "
He has predicted his meeting with Putin ' may be the easiest , ' so I have no reason to believe anything productive will come of it . "
Congress passed legislation earlier this year giving states a total of $ 380 million in grants to boost the security of their election systems .
Lawmakers also approved $ 26 million for DHS to strengthen election cyber security .
Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea thanked the House committee for the grants but said states need more money to replace their outdated equipment and boost their staffing .
WASHINGTON -- A top House Democrat said Wednesday it was time for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and her two long - time deputies to step aside and make way for a younger generation of leaders .
Rep. Linda Sanchez , the highest - ranking Latina in the House , first called for " generational change " last fall , but her fresh comments on Wednesday come at a time when Democrats are increasingly dissatisfied with Pelosi and uncertain about who could emerge as a possible successor .
Sanchez -- currently the vice chair of the Democratic conference , the No .
5 leadership slot -- also said she wants to be part of any " transition " to a new lineup . "
I think its time for that generational change , " Sanchez told reporters Wednesday . "
I want to be part of that transition , because I do nt intend to stay in Congress until I m in my 70s . "
Pelosi is 78 years old .
The No .
2 and No .
3 House Democrats , Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina , are also in their late 70s .
Sanchez suggested the trios continued grip on power was stymieing younger Democrats . "
I want to help create opportunities for some of the newer members , who have a lot to contribute but do nt necessarily always get the opportunity , " she said .
Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill offered a terse response : " House Democrats are focused on winning in November and if you are rowing in the opposite direction , you are only helping Republicans . "
Pelosi has made it clear that she wants to be speaker again if Democrats win a majority in the mid - term elections .
What 's not clear is if she will have enough support , since some Democrats are campaigning on a pledge to oppose her if they win .
Sanchezs dig also comes after Rep. Joe Crowley , a New York Democrat once seen as a possible successor to Pelosi , lost his primary in a stunning upset last month .
Crowleys defeat raised new questions about who could emerge as a successor to Pelosi , since other Democrats do not have the same broad support across the caucus .
Sanchez said she is considering a bid for Crowleys current role , chairman of the Democratic conference , the No .
4 position . "
I think I d do a good job as chair of the caucus but I am not prepared to make a decision , " she said . "
I m still talking with colleagues . "

WASHINGTON -- For the wealthiest Americans , there may never be a better time to get divorced .
A change in the new Republican tax law will eliminate a tax break for alimony payments that are finalized after Dec. 31 , prompting financial planners and lawyers to warn wealthy clients that if they have been contemplating filing for divorce , they had better act fast .
Under the law , Americans who finalize or modify divorce agreements in 2019 or later will no longer be able to deduct alimony payments from their taxes .
Agreements signed before the end of the year will still qualify for the annual deduction -- a distinction with large financial implications for couples where one partner earns substantially more per year than the other . "
I have never wanted to counsel people , hurry up and get a divorce , " said Fern Frolin , a divorce lawyer at Mirick OConnell in Boston , whose clients often have high incomes . "
I always want to say , ' Take your time , think if this is the right thing for you .
But in this particular instance , we could be talking about 15 to 20 years of support , and shifting the tax burden for the last years of a persons working life . "
More from The New York Times : For decades , Americans paying alimony to a former spouse have been able to deduct the payments from their taxes , providing a potentially generous tax break depending on the size of the payments and the gap in earnings between spouses .
About 600,000 taxpayers claim the deduction each year , according to the Internal Revenue Service .
Under the current system , people paying alimony can deduct those payments -- no matter how big the amount -- from their income before calculating what they owe in taxes .
That deduction provides a significant benefit to the wealthiest Americans , whose top tax rate is 37 percent and who would otherwise owe taxes on all of their income , including what they paid out in alimony .
Right now , the rich disproportionately deduct alimony -- about 20 percent of taxpayers who currently claim the deduction are in the top 5 percent of household income earners .
Eliminating the benefit will hit certain types of divorced couples harder , primarily hurting those who earn vastly different amounts of income and are taxed at different rates .
Under the current code , if the person paying alimony earns substantially more than their former spouse , he or she generally negotiates a higher payment because the payer can deduct the full amount from his or her income and the former spouse , who earns less , pays a lower tax rate on alimony payment .
The new treatment takes away that benefit , putting pressure on high earners to pay more to support their former spouses -- or hurting the lower - earning spouse , if the higher earner demands to pay less to make up for the lost tax break .
The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates elimination of the tax break will increase federal revenues by $ 7 billion over the course of a decade .
Its elimination is one of several provisions in the new $ 1.5 trillion law that affect high - earning married couples , including so - called marriage penalties on couples earning more than $ 600,000 a year .
That penalty , which was eliminated for middle- and lower - income couples , makes it less advantageous for high - income married couples to file jointly because they hit the top marginal tax bracket faster than they would if each party filed separately .
The law also caps the amount of state and local taxes that couples can deduct at $ 10,000 a year , which is the same as the cap for single filers -- a disadvantage for couples .
Lawyers warn that the loss of the alimony deduction could disproportionately hurt women , who are the more frequent recipients of alimony payments and who face a higher risk of income decline after divorce than men .
It could also reduce the welfare of some children .
Child support payments are not deductible , but so - called unallocated support -- payments that are meant to help a divorcing spouse and children at the same time -- is deductible .
That deductibility will also end for any new or modified divorce agreements , starting in 2019 .
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump 's pick for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , visited Capitol Hill Tuesday to meet with key Republican senators as liberal and conservative activists geared up for a pitched battle on his confirmation .
Before Trump announced his nomination of Kavanaugh on Monday , some news reports suggested that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R - Ky . ,
was concerned that the lengthy record of the 53-year - old appeals court judge could drag out the confirmation process .
But McConnell , who met with Kavanaugh in his office , praised him on Tuesday as a " great nominee " who deserves bipartisan support . "
I think the president has done it once again , " McConnell told reporters . "
He s one of the premier legal talents in the country .
He s got a long record that people can examine .
What we d like to see is a few open minds about this extraordinary talent . "
Chuck Grassley , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , who also met with Kavanaugh , promised a " thorough " but speedy confirmation process . "
Well try to do what we can to accommodate everybodys interests , " said the Iowa Republican . "
In the end , I think his record speaks for itself . "
Republicans control the Senate by a slim 51 - 49 majority , meaning McConnell has little room for defections .
Conservatives are hoping to win over at least some moderate Democratic senators to solidify Kavanaugh 's chances .
Some Democrats , including Sen. Joe Donnelly , D - Ind . ,
have said they are at least open to considering Trump 's nominee . "
I m reviewing the court cases that he s made , his writings , I plan to listen to the testimony , hopefully interview with him and so this is the beginning of the process , " said Donnelly , who is up for re - election in the fall in a state Trump won by 19 percentage points .
Two moderate Republican senators whose votes will be crucial to his prospects , Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , both said they wanted to review his record carefully before making up their minds on whether to back him . "
I believe that the judge has impressive credentials .
He clearly has extensive experience having spent more than a decade as a judge on the D.C. circuit , " Collins told reporters Tuesday .
Conservative and liberal advocacy groups have mapped out multi - million dollar campaigns targeting the half - dozen or so lawmakers seen as swing votes , drawing up details even before Trump nominated Kavanaugh .
As liberal groups focus on Collins and Murkowski , conservatives are targeting Donnelly , Doug Jones of Alabama , Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota , and Joe Manchin of West Virginia .
A reliable conservative The stakes are high .
If the Senate confirms Kavanaugh to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy , his addition to the court could shift it further to the right for decades .
Kennedy was a key swing vote in cases upholding abortion , affirmative action and gay rights .
Both liberal and conservative activists believe Kavanaugh would be more reliably conservative on those and other issues .
Kavanaugh , who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , is a favorite of the conservative legal establishment because of his long record on issues ranging from the separation of powers and executive privilege to abortion , immigration and gun rights .
His nomination must be approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee and then by the full Senate .
Senate Democrats have vowed to fight the nomination , saying he would endanger health care protections and help overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade case , which legalized abortion .
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , reiterated his pledge to " fight this nominee with everything I 've got . "
Speaking with other Democrats on the steps of the Supreme Court Tuesday , the New York Democrat said one focus will be Kavanaugh 's positions on presidential powers .
Kavanaugh , who has written that Congress should consider exempting sitting presidents from criminal prosecution or investigation , would be a " barrier " against Trump being forced to testify in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election , Schumer said .
Kavanaugh has also written that presidents do n't have to follow laws they deem unconstitutional until a final court order says otherwise . "
To say that if a president deems a law unconstitutional , he does n't have to obey it , that 's dangerous at any time , but it 's particularly dangerous when Donald Trump is president and we are going to make this a major and important issue , " Schumer said .
Trumps nomination , coming less than two weeks after Kennedy announced his retirement , will begin " courtesy calls " on Capitol Hill with the senators who will determine his fate .
Those closed - door visits will be carefully choreographed , but they re unlikely to change very many hearts and minds .
Democrats say they 'll request every possible document they can get , especially from his time in the George W. Bush White House . "
His public record is a very deep mine that has to be explored , " said Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D - Conn .
Vice President Mike Pence , who was accompanying Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill , expressed confidence about the nominees prospects . "
Were honored to be able to bring him here ... and begin the important work that the Senate will do in discharging its constitutional duties to consider this good man as the presidents nominee to the Supreme Court , " Pence said as he , McConnell , and Kavanaugh posed for the cameras .
Sen. John Thune , R - S.D. , who heads the Republican conference in the Senate , said he was nt worried about defections from Collins and Murkowski . "
I hope in the end when push comes to shove that ( Kavanaugh ) will have acquitted himself in a way that will allow all 50 of our Republican senators to be able to vote for him , " Thune said .
WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trumps broadsides against NATO have rattled a 69-year military alliance that largely defined the global order following World War II .
But Trump is nt the only modern U.S. president to raise questions about the reliance of European nations on American defense spending .
Here 's a glimpse of NATO 's history , its mission and its funding sources .
NATO 's historic roots The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 with Europe still reeling from the war 's devastation .
With an eye toward communist expansion aided by the Soviet Union , the U.S. , Canada and 10 other nations decided a system of collective defense was in every members best interest .
A centerpiece of the treaty , which was signed by then President Harry Truman , is the Article 5 provision that requires member states to come to the aid of their allies in the event of an attack .
The provision has been invoked only once - in 2001 when the U.S. was the target of terrorist attacks .
Global military might NATO has since grown to 29 member states that , according to the organizations website , are committed to " guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and military means . "
The organization is headquartered in Brussels , and summits are generally held every year or two .
Historians have credited NATO with unifying Western democracies during the Cold War , but the organization has faced internal struggles .
France formally pulled out of the groups military command in the 1960s , angering the U.S. , and then rejoined in 2009 .
Who pays for NATO ?
Trump , who ran on a platform of putting " America First , " has a long history of questioning U.S. involvement overseas .
He has specifically railed against NATO members for not contributing more money to their own defense .
He s not the first to raise such questions .
President Barack Obama , speaking at a press conference shortly after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 , said he was concerned " about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in NATO . "
Months later , NATO members pledged to spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024 .
So far , only five countries are meeting that goal -- the U.S , the United Kingdom , Greece , Estonia and Latvia .
Others have noted they still have several more years to meet the target .
The U.S. spends the highest share of GDP , at 3.5 percent , and Luxembourg spends the lowest , at just over half of 1 percent .

WASHINGTON -- The federal judge overseeing Paul Manafort 's upcoming trial on bank and tax fraud charges is giving prosecutors until Friday to respond to defense requests to move the case to Roanoke , Va. , and postpone its start currently slated for later this month .
With the former Trump campaign chief 's trial " looming on the horizon " in Alexandria , Va. , U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III ordered Russia special counsel Robert Mueller 's prosecution team Tuesday to address both venue and delay requests brought by the former chief of the Trump campaign .
Manafort 's attorneys have argued that the intense media coverage of their client 's case has saturated the potential jury pool , potentially prejudicing jurors against Manafort .
The attorneys also noted that voters in the Alexandria area overwhelmingly favored Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016 , another point of concern for the longtime Republican campaign operative .

To assist in that review , Ellis ordered Manafort moved Tuesday from a jail cell in Warsaw , Va. , where he has been held since his bail was revoked last month , to the Alexandria Detention Center to be closer to his attorneys .
Located in Richmond County , Warsaw is about 100 miles from the Washington , D.C. , area .
In September , Manafort faces a separate trial on money laundering charges in Washington , D.C.
WASHINGTON -- Corporations taking advantage of new , lower tax rates reduced their payments to the federal government last month .
The Treasury Department on Thursday said government receipts fell 7 % in June compared with the same month a year earlier , including a 33 % drop in gross corporate taxes .
Individual withheld and payroll taxes were down 5 % from June 2017 , while non - withheld individual taxes rose by 7 % .

Wells Fargo & Co. continued to disappoint investors with its earnings report released early Friday , but it still kept its sales people happy , as commissions and incentive pay increased while profit and revenue fell below expectations .
The stock WFC , -1.19 % tumbled as much as 4.3 % intraday , before paring losses to trade down 1.1 % in afternoon trade .
That puts the stock on track to decline on the day earnings were reported for the sixth - straight quarter , as well as for 11 of the past 12 quarters and 15 of the past 17 .
Wells Fargo reported before Fridays open second - quarter net earnings that fell to $ 5.19 billion , or 98 cents a share , from $ 5.86 billion , or $ 1.08 a share , in the same period a year ago , missing the FactSet consensus of $ 1.12 a share .
Total revenue declined 2 % to $ 21.55 billion , below the FactSet consensus of $ 21.68 billion .

Net interest income rose 1 % to $ 12.54 billion , mostly in line with the FactSet consensus of $ 12.55 billion , while non - interest income dropped 8 % to $ 9.01 billion to below expectations of $ 9.21 billion .
While non - interest income fell , expenses rose 3 % , as salaries increased 3 % to $ 4.47 billion and commission and incentive compensation jumped 6 % to $ 2.64 billion .
J.P. Gravitt , chief executive officer and head of research at independent market research company Market Realist , said one reason compensation keeps rising even though business is declining is that Wells Fargo still has a perception problem , not just with borrowers and investors , but also its own employees . "
What they re having to do as a company , they re having to work much harder to get business , " Gravitt said , " and they re trying harder to retain good people . "
Wells Fargo has had a perception problem since the banks sales practice scandal surfaced two years ago and revealed that the bank had opened millions of unauthorized accounts , fueled by an incentive structure that included daily sales quotas and aggressive account - opening targets .
Investigations that followed led to the Federal Reserve forcing the bank to oust board members and limit its growth .

The stock has lost 8.7 % year to date and 0.3 % over the past 12 months .

The company was founded by Henry Wells and William G. Fargo on March 18 , 1852 and is headquartered in San Francisco , CA .
Wells Fargo & Co. 's stock WFC , -1.19 % tumbled 3.8 % in morning trade Friday , enough to pace the S&P 500 's SPX , -1.18 % decliners , as the bank extended its streak of earnings disappointments to six quarters .
Including the current loss , the stock has now fallen on the day earnings were released after the past six reports , by an average of 2.5 % .
It is now on track to fall after 11 of the past 12 reports , and after 15 of the past 17 reports .
Earlier , the bank reported earnings that missed expectations , for the third time in the past four quarters , while total revenue has now missed for six of the past seven quarters .
The stock has now shed 3 % over the past 12 months , while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF , -1.11 % has gained 7 % and the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has climbed 14 % .
Wells Fargo & Co. 's WFC , -1.19 % second - quarter earnings and revenue fell below expectations , but that did n't stop the bank from boosting employee salaries and commissions .
The stock dropped 3 % in premarket trade .
Total noninterest income fell 8 % to $ 9.01 billion , but total noninterest expense rose 3 % to $ 13.98 billion , as salaries rose 3 % to $ 4.47 billion and commission and incentive compensation jumped 6 % to $ 2.64 billion .
However , employee benefits fell 5 % to $ 1.25 billion .
Overall net income fell 12 % to $ 4.79 billion , or 98 cents a share , below the FactSet consensus of $ 1.12 a share , while total revenue slipped 2 % to $ 21.55 billion , missing expectations of $ 12.68 billion .
The stock has shed 7.7 % year to date through Thursday , while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF , -1.11 % has lost 2.9 % and the S&P 500 SPX , -1.18 % has gained 4.7 % .
Were in the thick of earnings season , and so far company reports have been strong .
Corporate profits are booming , with research firm FactSet plotting a blended earnings growth rate of about 20 % for the S&P 500 Index SPX , -1.18 % .
Furthermore , more than one in five companies in the index issued positive guidance for second - quarter results going into this reporting season , which is the highest share since 2006 .
Of course , these favorable trends beg an important question : If earnings are so strong , why have nt the major indexes like the S&P 500 been able to reclaim the highs set in January ?
Uncertainty over trade policies is surely some of it , as is broader concern about valuations , as this bull market plods along well into its ninth year .
But a closer look shows that while the indexes have been choppy , there are plenty of individual stocks making big moves -- both to the upside and to the downside -- in 2018 .
To make the most of this high - octane earnings season , then , investors should be more discerning than just camping out in an index fund that gives you nearly equal shares of winners and losers .
Instead , a more tailored approach could pay off in a big way by tapping into the very best stocks , and avoiding the rest .
Here are seven sectors that are likely to make waves this earnings season , with a stock to buy and stock to sell in each .
Big Tech -- Buy Microsoft , Not IBM Microsoft MSFT , -0.15 % reports earnings later this week , on July 19 .
And if the past is any indication , the company will once again prove that it is successfully making the transition to a cloud - computing giant with a stable stream of enterprise revenue .
Shares have been trading around record highs after an impressive report in April , and investors should expect another strong showing in a few days .
Of course , that growth is nt shared among all Big Tech stocks .
IBM IBM , -0.15 % has declined about 5 % in 2018 , in large part because of a big move down in mid - April after first - quarter earnings .
Yes , IBM showed decent growth at the time , but it also gave investors a glimpse of a disappointing future , owing to narrowing margins and one - time benefits that spackled over challenges .
Those troubles are likely to come home to roost again in the second quarter , as IBM will report again on July 18 .
Big Banks -- Buy Bank of America , Not Wells Fargo Bank earnings this week seemed strong across the board .
But Bank of America BAC , -1.42 % stood out from the pack with strong results that sent the shares up about 5 % in two sessions after its Monday report ; profits and revenue topped expectations handily .
However , while corporate tax cuts and the prospect of higher interest rates lifted the financial sector as a whole , do nt be fooled into thinking that the big banks are all created equal .
While Wells Fargo WFC , -1.19 % rallied with its peers , shares were stuck in a rut leading up to this week , in part , because of the banks recent history of disappointing results -- to say nothing of recent scandals that have damaged its brand .
Wells may have had a decent run over the past few days , but is up only 4 % in the past 12 months vs. more than 20 % for Bank of America stock .
Do nt fall for the generic headlines , and put your money behind a better bank .
Payment Technology -- Buy Visa , Not American Express Beyond big banks , financial - services firms should also post strong numbers as a group -- and you can count on Visa V , -1.86 % to be at the head of the pack when it reports next week , on July 25 .
Despite a share price that has soared over 750 % in the past decade since its IPO , Visa continues to deliver , thanks to impressive growth ; the company is expecting another quarter of double - digit revenue expansion and earnings per share that will be up over 25 % year - over - year .
American Express AXP , -1.47 % is still very much in growth mode , too .
However , as Visa continues to expand into mobile - payments technology , there is a real risk that AmEx will be left behind .
This brand is nt going anywhere with its high - end customer base and great brand , but there s a reason AmExs stock is basically flat since its January highs while Visa is up an impressive 20 % this year .
Streaming Video -- Buy Bilibili , Not Netflix In case you ve been living under a rock , Netflix NFLX , -3.76 % crashed and burned this week after failing to live up to expectations of subscriber growth .
Sure , the stock has almost doubled this year , but momentum stocks like this can cause a lot of pain when they roll over -- as Netflix seems to be doing .
It may be hard not to hang on to Netflix if your cost basis is down under $ 100 a share .
But for new money , its safer to steer clear of this volatile stock right now .
Instead , consider Chinese streaming video play Bilibili Inc. BILI , -5.24 % .
This fast - growing company does nt report earnings until August , but you wo nt want to wait to get on board ; shares are already up 20 % from their spring IPO .
The platform has more than 77 million visitors , and is growing at a roughly 35 % clip -- with more than eight in 10 users under age 18 !
If you really want to play international streaming , look at this Asian player over Netflix , particularly after the recent fireworks .
Restaurants -- Buy Chipotle , Not Starbucks A few years ago , if you mentioned you were going to sell your shares of Starbucks SBUX , -0.89 % and buy Chipotle CMG , -2.51 % , you would have been laughed out of the room .
Shares of Chipotle were in free - fall in late 2015 and 2016 amid food - safety concerns , while Starbucks could seemingly do no wrong .
But while Chipotle certainly is nt perfect , the company has rebounded dramatically from lows at the end of 2017 , thanks to a surge of more than 20 % after a first - quarter earnings beat in April .
We could see another strong showing next week , on July 26 , as expectations remain muted .
Meanwhile , Starbucks has been struggling since its 2017 highs , and the departure of iconic exec Howard Schultz has left investors worried about the future .
It also reports July 26 , and after trouble in April around its first - quarter report , things are not looking up .
Starbucks is nt going anywhere and Chipotle is nt out of the woods , but its clear which stock has the wind at its back this earnings season .
Retailers -- Buy Macys , Not L Brands The age of e - commerce has not been easy for traditional retailers .
But after some growing pains , department store Macys M , -4.63 % seems to be getting its act together lately .
Shares have moved in almost a straight line higher since October , giving Macys stock a 12-month return of more than 60 % owing to a blowout earnings report in May that included a big boost to forward guidance .
That hints at another strong report in August .
The story could not be more different for Victorias Secret operator L Brands US : LB , however .
L Brands stock is down by double - digits in 2018 as anemic revenue growth continues to squeeze the company .
Worse , the company slashed its outlook in May , a sure sign of continued trouble to come for this retailer .
Health Care -- Buy Align , Not J&J While mega - cap health - care company Johnson & Johnson JNJ , +1.38 % and mid - sized dental - products player Align Technologies ALGN , -1.51 % are not exactly peers , its important to note how they exemplify different approaches to health - care investing -- and one that is particularly noteworthy this earnings season .
On one hand , you have a diversified but lumbering behemoth in J&J. Shares are down 10 % so far this year , and while it beat on revenue and profits on Tuesday , it did nt show any growth potential to investors .
Still , the stock was up Tuesday .
Contrast that with Align , which reports next week , on July 25 .
The company is projecting more than 30 % revenue growth this year , and earnings that will be up almost as much .
In January , Align broke out immediately after impressive results .
And while it simply held the line in its April report , shares have rallied strongly in anticipation of the growth it will show this July report .
There s a reason why J&J is in the red while Align has more than doubled in the last year .
That reason is growth , and investors should chase it here and in all of their health - care investments this earnings season vs. the stagnant mega - caps with little upside .
Wharton professor and organizational psychologist Adam Grant is an expert in the science behind a fulfilling career .
In addition to his work as a Saul P. Steinberg Professor of Management at The University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School , he 's written three New York Times bestselling books on workplace culture and psychology , and he 's the host of " WorkLife , " a podcast produced by TED .
Over his career , Grant has heard a lot of advice given to young people .
And even if it 's pervasive , not all conventional wisdom is helpful , Grant tells CNBC Make It .
The worst career advice ?
Planning your career in advance . "
It 's a terrible idea , because the world is changing way too fast to know today what opportunities will exist in four or five years , " Grant explains . "
I think that so often , people get locked into one direction long before they have any clue what 's out there , and long before the most interesting opportunities even exist . "
To explain the idea , Grant points to billionaire Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg , with whom he co - authored " Option B. " Today , she 's Facebook 's chief operating officer , but when she was just starting her career , social media did n't even exist . "
Mark Zuckerberg was only 7 years old when I graduated from college , " Sandberg writes in " Lean In . "
And in the early 1990s as a student at Harvard University , Sandberg was n't particularly tech savvy . "
I used Harvard 's computer system only once as an undergraduate , to run regressions for my senior thesis on the economics of spousal abuse , " she writes in the book . "
The data was stored on large , heavy magnetic tapes that I had to lug in big boxes across campus , cursing the entire way and arriving in a sweaty mess at the sole computer center which was populated exclusively with male student .
I then had to stay up all night spinning the tapes to input the data . "
Then , the system crashed . "
That 's right .
Years before Mark [ Zuckerberg ] famously crashed that same Harvard system , I beat him to it , " Sandberg remembers .
So , if she had planned out her career in its entirety after graduating college , she likely would n't have considered a high tech route . "
I could never have connected the dots from where I started to where I am today , " Sandberg explains .
She agrees with Grant , making a concrete plan is n't a good idea .
But you should keep some focus in sight . "
While I do n't believe in mapping out each step of a career , I do believe it helps to have a long - term dream or goal , " she writes .
Looking for the right career " requires both focus and flexibility , so I recommend adopting two concurrent goals : a long - term dream and an eighteen - month plan . "
Grant suggests a similar tact to CNBC Make It : " You should start by figuring out what skills you want to learn or who you want to learn from , and go to the organization that will best prepare you for that , " he says . "
Then stay until you feel like you 're not learning anymore . "
And , always keep your eyes open for new opportunities .

Wharton 's Jeremy Siegel on stocks and the economy Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School , University of Pennsylvania , reports on the market 's resiliency to trade war and Fed concerns .
What could be worse than being diagnosed and treated for cancer ?
Later finding out that your doctor lied and you never had it to begin with .
A Michigan office manager risked his career to expose a doctor who gave chemotherapy to patients who did not have cancer .
Dr. Farid Fata gave unnecessary treatments to more than 500 patients at a Detroit - area cancer center .
In the latest episode of the CBS series " Whistleblower , " airing at Friday , July 20 8/7c , host Alex Ferrer talks to the former office manager who stepped forward to expose the man responsible . "
I could n't believe ... what was in front of me .
I could n't believe what I was seeing , " says George Karadsheh , who took a new job in 2011 as an office manager for Dr. Fata 's rapidly expanding oncology practice in suburban Detroit .
But within two years , one of the other oncologists and two nurse practitioners announced they were leaving .
Karadsheh confronted that other oncologist . " '
Are you leaving ? '
And he said , ' Yes . '
And I said , ' Can I ask you why ? ' "
said Karadsheh .
What the doctor told Karadsheh about Fata was a bombshell . "
Patients were given chemotherapy and other treatments when they did n't have cancer , " he said .
Robert Sobieray was referred to Dr. Fata by his back surgeon . "
I heard he was one of the best there is , " he said .
Dr. Farid Fata Dr. Fata did a bone marrow biopsy . "
Two weeks later , he turned around and said , ' You 've got multiple myeloma . ...
It 's a blood cancer or bone destroying disease , ' " said Sobieray .
He began monthly chemotherapy infusions . "
I 'd become weak , sick to my stomach , tired all the time . ...
I could n't walk anymore , " Sobieray explained . "
The chemotherapy ... eventually destroyed all my teeth . "
Sobieray went to see a different oncologist .
He was shaken by what he heard . "
He says , ' I 've seen both biopsies .
There 's nothin' that says that you had cancer anywhere in there , ' " said Sobieray . "
I was shocked .
It was worse than hearin ' that you have cancer . " "
I was determined to have this doctor stop harming people , " said Karadsheh . "
I could n't believe someone would do anything this terrible to another human being , " said whistleblower George Karadsheh . "
People were being disabled by treatments they never needed . "
CBS News His head spinning , Karadsheh contacted an attorney he knew who handled whistleblower cases .
He believed he might have a strong case . "
We 've heard a lot of strange stories about fraud .
But that one was beyond fraud .
It was cruel .
It was criminal .
It was risking people with poison , " said attorney David Haron .
Haron wasted no time and called the Department of Justice . "
Without a doubt , this is the fastest and most intense lawsuit I 've ever handled in this area , " he said .
George Karadsheh was willing to put everything on the line . "
My job was at stake .
My livelihood , " he explained . "
Even my own personal safety . "
I was n't looking at the patients anymore as being treated , " Karadsheh said . "
I looked at it as a burning building with people inside . ...
I had to make it stop and I had to make it stop quickly . "
How did could Fata get away with something like this for so long without anyone knowing ?
Ferrer told " CBS This Morning " co - host Gayle King , " In private practice , doctors have little to no oversight .
He would provide the chemotherapy in his office - so it was even more unlikely that he would be caught .
On the rare occasion he did go to a hospital , it was before 6 a.m. or after 11 a.m. so no one was questioning his medical decisions . "
Ferrer called it the perfect fraud and was based on greed . "
In a short amount of time Fata subjected over 500 patients to unnecessary treatment . "
What decides politicians votes ?
Campaign contributions and constituents priorities play a role , but a new study suggests that a legislators personal life can be hugely influential .
As the share of state legislators who attended a states public colleges goes up , so too does the funding for the states entire public university system , according to a working paper circulated Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
The paper distributed this week is the final version of research that was previously made public .
The study , by researchers at Duke Universitys Fuqua School of Business , found that with each additional state legislator who attended one of the states public colleges or universities , funding for the entire state university system increased by 0.5 % or by $ 4.9 million annually on average . "
The personal experiences of these legislators seem to have an important effect on the legislation they pass , " said Ryan McDevitt , one of the authors of the study and a Fuqua professor .
Wonder how we got to over $ 1 trillion in student debt ?
Watch this .
The findings could even have implications beyond higher education funding , McDevitt said .
The research suggests voters or organizations interested in any particular issue should look to legislators with a personal connection to move it forward , he said , citing a doctor - turned - politician who may be more sympathetic to health care - related proposals .
The study is , of course , most relevant to the relationship lawmakers have with their alma maters .
The findings suggest that legislators will actually act on the warm feelings they have towards the school they attended , McDevitt said . "
Its different from just rooting for the team on Saturday , " he said .
The researchers found that electing one more legislator who graduated from a given campus among the states four - year public universities is associated with a 39 % or $ 19 million annual increase in state funding to that campus . "
At a practical level if you re interested in securing higher funding for your states universities and colleges you should be lobbying for and advocating for the legislators who went to these state schools . "
Securing state funding has become especially important to public colleges over the last several years .
Faced with strapped budgets during the Great Recession , states slashed their funding for higher education and even with the economic recovery few states have returned to funding their public colleges at pre - recession levels .
The schools raised tuition in part in response to the cuts .
As a result much of the financial burden of a public college education has shifted from the government to families .
Despite the historic cuts during this period , legislators who had attended their states public college system served as protectors of sorts as state budgets declined , according to the study . "
The legislatures that had more in - state educated legislators were less willing to cut funding , " McDevitt said . "
It was a buffer to the decline in funding that other states saw . "

When Amazon.com Inc.s Prime Day wraps midweek , half of the e - commerce giants shoppers will own an Alexa device , experts say .
Amazon AMZN , -1.81 % has put a spotlight on its devices , with many announced deals on Alexa - enabled items like $ 20 off the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote , $ 100 off the Echo Look and a $ 30 discount on the Fire HD8 tablet with Alexa . "
Given that 39 % of Amazon shoppers claim to own an Alexa - connected device , and 10 % of Amazon shoppers who do not own an Alexa - connected device plan to buy one this Prime Day , we can expect that close to half of all Amazon shoppers will own an Alexa - connected device after Prime Day 2018 , " according to data provided by InfoScout , a consumer insight provider that s part of Market Track .
Last year , the Echo Dot was the best - selling product of the shopping event , which runs for 36 hours after its 3 p.m. Eastern start on Monday and included some specials in the lead - up .
Prime Day 2017 ended with sales up 60 % year - over - year .
Fire tablets and Kindle devices also reached record sales .
How everything around you could soon turn into a subscription Read : Amazon Prime Day will take a bite out of the food sector as Whole Foods is included Even with the focus on Alexa , InfoScout suggests that Amazon place its energies elsewhere . "
While Amazon will likely prioritize its marketing efforts on its Alexa - enabled voice assistants for Prime Day 2018 , their Amazon Fire TV products may be the more effective ' gateway product to getting consumers on the smart device bandwagon , " the report said .
Still , with more consumers turning to voice - controlled devices , highlighting Alexa devices is a good idea , others say .
Data from Narvar , a company that helps retailers provide a better customer experience , bears that out , with the company finding that device ownership and voice shopping nearly doubled in a six - month period .
Also : What NOT to buy on Amazon Prime Day " The voice opportunity is massive and major players like Amazon see it as an important customer touchpoint , " said Amit Sharma , Narvars chief executive and founder . "
Consumers will soon rely on voice assistants at all points of their shopping journey , so its smart for Amazon - and other retailers - to invest in this channel by prompting users to tap virtual assistant for everything from product search to order updates and returns . "
Retailers have recognized the " halo effect " that Prime Day has , with mass merchants and other competitors , like Target Corp. TGT , -1.41 % , hosting their own shopping events and offering discounts in order to snap up sales . "
Given the ongoing price war between Amazon and Walmart WMT , -2.48 % across multiple categories , and the ripple effects creating collateral damage for others , we see the industry caught in the throes of ' retail Darwinism , which is a credit negative for mostly all but the largest , higher credit quality retailers , " said Charlie OShea , Moodys retail analyst , in a comment .
See : Amazon takes Prime Day perks beyond e - commerce to drive traffic to Whole Foods stores " In other words , fighting the margin battle is a no - win situation for most mid- to smaller - tier retailers .
Match or undercut deep discount deals and see your margins erode - or do nothing and lose the sale , and potentially the customer . "
CFRAs Tuna Amobi expects success for Amazon this Prime Day , particularly with the companys devices . "
With over one million deals planned exclusively for Amazon Prime members , this years event could mark the most successful iteration yet for the annual shopping extravaganza , each of which has successively topped the prior year since its ' 15 inception , " Amobi wrote .
The Prime member base is more than 100 million , according to Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos .
Do nt miss : Thanks to Amazon Prime Day , the back - to - school shopping season is already under way " Again , we think popular categories will likely include hardware devices ( Echo / Alexa , Fire TV , Kindle ) as well consumer electronics , toys and other categories , " Amobi said .
Barclays raised its price target to $ 1,850 from $ 1,700 ahead of the event .

But What If We 're Wrong ? :
Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past " by Chuck Klosterman
When investors speak with their pocketbooks , it usually means something .
If we pay attention , we may even be able to gather some insight and get ahead of the curve .
This is especially true leading up to earnings releases .
Some might even think that the big boys know something we do nt , but if we watch , we can see what they are doing .
This was true with Netflix NFLX , -3.76 % leading up to Mondays earnings report .
As recently as July 10 , Netflix was strong on a near - term , medium - term and longer - term basis .
Review my July 10 article to see this and other stocks that were strong .
Read : More than 5 million U.S. consumers will cut the cord in 2018 However , between then and the day before earnings were released ( six days ) , Netflix changed .
The stock remained strong on a medium - term and longer - term basis , but it turned weak near term .
Review the Netflix report from July 16 to see this .
In a few short days , leading up to earnings , Netflix fell fast enough for it to go from near - term strong to near - term weak .
That is a rapid decline , and one might argue that it told us what the smart money ( professional investors ) was doing with their pocketbooks .
In this case , they were selling Netflix ahead of earnings .
The stock was down over 10 % after earnings were reported , so the price action leading up to the earnings report may have been an advance warning .
So far , it seems right .
During earnings season , this same thing can happen for other stocks as well .
We should keep our eyes open for aggressive price moves , like Netflixs ahead of earnings announcements , because they could be an indicator of what will happen after earnings releases are announced .

When it comes to worrying , you re a seasoned pro .
You tend to think about what can go wrong almost by default .
Now that you re retired , there s so much to fear : running out of money , facing a health crisis , safeguarding the future of your children or grandchildren .
Worrying is your new full - time job .
Lifelong worriers rarely turn into carefree optimists in retirement .
With more time on their hands , the temptation to succumb to negative emotions -- and dream up worst - case scenarios -- can foil your best intentions .
In theory , seniors are supposed to acquire the wisdom to think positively .
Worry levels for most people peak in their 40s and early 50s and then ebb as they age , researchers say .
You re not experiencing that ebbing .
To worry less , start by exerting more control over your mental outlook .
Experiment with ways to redirect your thoughts away from aimless fretting . "
If you say , ' Do nt worry , that does nt work , " said Melanie Greenberg , a clinical psychologist in Mill Valley , Calif. " Its better to interrupt the cycle by finding something else to think about . "
To help her patients fend off bouts of anxiety , Greenberg suggests a range of exercises .
When they feel the urge to worry , she might urge them to take a walk or initiate other physical activity . "
Getting active activates a different part of the brain , " she said . "
You can also activate your senses by paying attention to your breath , doing a crossword puzzle , looking out the window or describing three things that you see around you in the room . "
The $ 80 billion fitness industry sees huge growth in this demographic Sensory stimuli play a vital role .
Carrying lavender oil or sucking on a mint can stir your senses so that you re less attuned to your worries , adds Greenberg , author of " The Stress - Proof Brain . "
If you re too wedded to worry to stop it in its tracks , limit its impact .
Set aside a specific chunk of time , perhaps six or eight hours from now , to give yourself permission to worry . "
Say that you ll worry between 6:00 and 7:00 this evening , " Greenberg said . "
By the time you get to 6:00 , you may have forgotten or be distracted . "
Surrounding yourself with upbeat friends helps .
Playing bridge or joining a community board or book club can provide a social outlet that doubles as a fun or challenging diversion . "
As you age , you can become lonely , " said Jeannette Franks , a retired gerontologist in Bainbridge Island , Wash. " Friendship is really important .
People can find it very comforting to be part of a group that meets regularly . "
Better yet , sensible friends can transform your worry into a practical action plan .
Through gentle questioning , they can guide you to resources that alleviate your concern -- or at least help you rein in runaway anxiety .
Ideally , they ll ask , " What have you tried so far to address this ? "
rather than dishing out advice ( " You should do this ... " ) . "
Its good to prepare for legitimate worries , like getting dementia , " said Franks , author of " To Move or To Stay Put . " "
Worries change after you retire .
You always worry somethings going to happen , like falls and fractures . "
A little perspective goes a long way .
Rather than dwell on what can go wrong next week or next month , step back and view your life from a distance . "
If you re worried about the current situation , look at all the hurdles you ve already overcome , " said Spencer Blalock , a licensed clinical social worker in Meridian , Miss. " You may have lost your job or got divorced .
If you look at your history , there s always recovery .
Then you can say , ' I ve survived so many things .
I can do it again . "
When life gives you lemons , make lemonade .
That s the logic behind writing options in a volatile market .
The reward for giving someone else the option to buy or sell something has gone way up this year .
Last year was among the least volatile in the history of the stock market , based on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index , or VIX -- a measure of volatility reflecting the prices of one month put and call options .
Its average of just over 11 for 2017 was the lowest since the index was introduced in 1986 .
This year , however , fear is back -- and so are healthy prices for writing options .
Getty Images " With premiums much higher this year , its a good time to write options , " said Sterling Neblett , a certified financial planner and founding partner of advisory firm Centurion Wealth . "
It can be a good strategy in volatile , choppy markets . "
Option - writing strategies range from conservative ( covered calls and collars ) to extremely risky ( naked puts ) .
With the virtually unlimited variations of strike prices and expiration dates available , investors can customize their risk / reward parameters with remarkable precision .
For someone worried about the risk of a concentrated stock position , options can reduce their exposure in a tax - efficient way . "
I can dial down beta [ market risk ] for a client by 50 percent using options without triggering a big tax bill , " said Dave Donnelly , managing director of SpiderRock Advisors .
Donnellys firm implements option trading strategies for institutional investors to either hedge risk exposures or generate income from a portfolio .
He also offers the service to financial advisors who do nt feel capable of managing option positions for their clients .
Most financial advisors suggest that unless you fully understand the risks of buying or selling options and are prepared to manage positions , you should leave it to an expert .
Its not for everyone .
More from Straight Talk : How to simplify your financial life ... with two sheets of paper Ken Nuttall , director of financial planning with Black Diamond Wealth Management , said he uses option - writing strategies -- mostly covered call writing -- with 15 percent to 20 percent of his clients . "
Our usual strategy is to use options as a way to enhance income from a portfolio , " he said .
Options are powerful tools that carry embedded leverage and far more risk than the underlying securities in the contracts .
Premiums are richer now because the risks involved are higher .
Buy a call option and it can become near worthless overnight after a bad earnings release .
Write one and your potential losses are unlimited if the market surges upward .
Its essential that investors understand what their objective is and how much risk they re taking with the contracts .
Here are three common option strategies that can generate income and/or limit losses from an investment portfolio .
1 .
Covered calls and collars The most common , conservative way to take advantage of rich option premiums is to write call options on securities you already own .
If you re invested in stock funds , you can write on stock indexes -- though the premiums are generally less than on individual stocks .
At the end of June , an option expiring on Aug. 3 to buy 100 shares of Apple at the strike price of $ 195 costs $ 2.25 .
That amounts to a 1.2 percent return on a monthly basis , roughly 15 percent annually , assuming you can repeat the process for 12 months .
Neblett at Centurion Wealth targets high - dividend paying stocks with a 3 percent to 4 percent yield annually and looks to add 6 percent to 7 percent by writing calls on the shares . "
We want a 1.5 percent [ monthly ] return for writing slightly out of the money options , " said Neblett , who prefers individual stock options and keeps durations short to limit risk .
The risk in the strategy is that the stock rises significantly and your shares are called away at the strike price .
In other words , you limit your potential upside from owning the stock in return for the premium income you receive .
Writing calls does not eliminate the risk of holding the investment .
The option premium provides a cushion against losses , but if the stock or index falls dramatically , so will the value of your holdings .
If investors want downside protection , they can buy puts on the position simultaneously .
A collar -- often called a costless collar -- strategy uses the premiums from writing call options to purchase out of the money puts that limit the downside risk on an investment .
Two things to keep in mind : The longer the term on a call option , the more premium you ll receive , but the greater the risk that your investment is called away .
Single stock options pay better premiums than those on an index such as the .
They are also riskier and more volatile .
2 .
Straddles and strangles Option straddles and strangles are not writing strategies that generate premium income , but rather pure plays on volatility .
If an investor believes that a stock or index is going to have a big move either up or down , a straddle can help them benefit from it while limiting the potential risk .
Its like gambling .
You re speculating on the short - term direction of an asset .
Sterling Neblett founding partner , Centurion Wealth The strategy involves buying a put and call option with the same strike price and maturity on a single security or index . "
We usually use a straddle for a specific position a client may have , and the objective is to profit from a big move in the shares either way , " Neblett said .
Investors hope that one of the options expires worthless and the other results in a windfall .
The worst - case scenario is that the underlying stock does nt move at all and both options expire worthless .
You lose your entire investment in that scenario .
The break - even point is when the value of one of the options equals the cost of buying the two contracts .
If you believe there is a better chance of the underlying stock moving one way or the other , a strangle is a potential variation on the strategy .
Like a straddle , the investor buys a put and call option on the same stock with the same duration but at different strike prices .
If you believe the stock price will go up , buy the put at a lower strike price than the call .
It costs less , increasing your potential return on a positive move , but still provides some downside protection .
3 .
Writing puts Never write naked .
Financial advisors agree that writing call options when you do nt own the underlying securities , or put options when you do nt have the cash to fulfill the contract , is a recipe for disaster . "
Writing put and call options naked is where people get into trouble , " said Nuttall at Black Diamond Wealth Management . "
Its like gambling , " added Centurion Wealths Neblett . "
You re speculating on the short - term direction of an asset . "
That does nt mean you have to avoid writing put option contracts .
But you do need to have the cash to buy the shares if the market falls and the option is executed by the buyer .
The advantage of writing puts is that they generally carry higher premiums than call options do . "
For a client holding taxable or municipal bonds , we can sell out of the money put options on the S&P 500 index and increase their income from 200 to 500 basis points , " said Donnelly at SpiderRock Advisors . "
The equity risk involved depends on how far out of the money you go . "
For example , you may like Apple stock but are worried that its overvalued at $ 185 .
If you write a put option with a strike price of $ 175 , you get the premium income and the " opportunity " to buy the stock at a lower price . "
You get paid to buy the stock at your desired price , " said Neblett at Centurion Wealth .

When recent college grads Luke Holden and Ben Conniff opened a hole - in - the - wall , 200-square - foot lobster shack in New York City 's East Village in the fall of 2009 , they were wholly unprepared .
The economy was still struggling and neither Holden , a 25-year - old banking analyst , nor Conniff , a 24-year - old freelance food writer , had any restaurant - management experience .
The two had recently met through Craigslist and gave themselves a two - month timeframe to open their shack , which they dubbed " Luke 's Lobster . " "
We were very naive out of the gate , " Holden , the company 's CEO , recalls . "
We were just a couple of inexperienced , hungry , can't - say - no , going - to - find - the - answer - on - Google - type individuals . "
Co - founders Luke Holden and Ben Conniff on a fishing vessel off the coast of Maine .
CNBC Holden had graduated from Georgetown University in 2007 and moved to New York City to work in finance .
As an analyst at Cohen and Steers Capital Advisors , he eventually earned nearly $ 150,000 a year in salary and bonuses .
At 25 , he had an extremely comfortable lifestyle -- but something was missing . "
He called me one day , " Holden 's dad , Jeff , tells CNBC Make It , " and said , ' I 'm making great money down here , I 've got great friends , but I just do n't like what I 'm doing . ' "
Holden did have an idea he was excited about : a lobster shack .
Growing up in the coastal town of Cape Elizabeth , Maine , his childhood revolved around the ocean .
Restless with his corporate job and nostalgic for home , Holden decided to return to his family roots .
In the summer of 2009 he started searching online for a high - quality , affordable , authentic Maine lobster roll , but was disappointed with the results .
They were either too expensive ( in the $ 30 range ) , poorly frozen , or had too much " mayo - celery , " Holden says . "
When I graduated from Georgetown , I really did n't have a clue what I wanted to do , " Holden says .
Luke Holden At the time , the only concept that came close to what he was looking for was an operation being run out of a basement in Brooklyn by another young New England - bred lobsterman , known as " Doktor Klaw . "
Holden saw a hole in the market .
He called his dad , who had 50 years of experience as a Maine lobsterman , dealer and processor , and asked him to be a 50 - 50 investor in the first Luke 's Lobster shack .
The elder Holden borrowed against his 401(K ) while the younger tapped into savings from his banking job .
By most standards , it was a modest investment .
Together , the Holdens invested a total of around $ 45,000 .
According to the industry site RestaurantOwner.com , total startup costs typically range from $ 125,000 on the low end to $ 494,888 on the high end . "
I feel like I had nothing to lose , " Luke , now 34 , says . "
My heart was 100 percent in it . "
Making waves According to a study by Cornell University , 26 percent of restaurants fail in their first year , and Luke 's Lobster seemed destined to be one of those statistics .
Employees handed customers food without a plate or utensils when they were low on paper products .
When there were n't enough dollar bills in the cash register , cashiers distributed change in nickels .
The air conditioning frequently broke , and there never seemed to be enough people on hand to run the restaurant .
The company prepares for its first store opening in the fall of 2009 .
Luke 's Lobster Conniff , the company 's president , says he was " running around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to get things figured out . "
But the high - stress environment helped the team bond , fast .
Conniff and Holden took on the same jobs as their employees .
Everyone at Luke 's Lobster -- including family members -- pitched in to keep the business afloat .
When lobster was in short supply , Holden 's dad would drive the meat halfway from Maine to New York City .
Sometimes , he 'd drive all the way , put in a 10-hour shift at the restaurant , then drive the 300-plus miles home .
Despite the chaos , customers came and returned .
They were eager to try the tender Maine lobster , shrimp and crab rolls offered at a fraction of the price ( $ 4 to $ 14 ) of those at New York City 's upscale restaurants , and without the usual accompanying river of mayonnaise .
The friendly , no - frills , at - times - apologetic atmosphere made customers eager to support the fledgling entrepreneurs . "
I think we got away with a lot that we would not get away with as a bigger company , " says Conniff .
Luke 's Lobster president Ben Conniff , early investor Jeff Holden and CEO Luke Holden ( L to R ) during the early years of Luke 's Lobster .
Luke 's Lobster Nearly nine years later , that lobster shack has grown into a global food brand .
Today , Luke 's Lobster has 29 " shacks " across the U.S. , a seven - location licensing deal in Japan , a single - shack licensing deal in Taiwan , a traveling food truck , a deal selling lobster tails to Whole Foods and several partnerships with small food businesses .
The company generated approximately $ 30 million in sales in 2017 and employs just under 500 people .
Holden and Conniff attribute much of their success to embracing risk , following their gut and being willing to accept guidance .
Today , they are no longer preoccupied with managing a restaurant and keeping it stocked .
With five shacks having opened in the past 10 months and more on the horizon -- including the company 's first west coast location opening in San Francisco this fall -- there are new obstacles ahead .
Luke 's Lobster added shacks in Chicago , Boston , Miami , Washington , D.C. and New York City over the past 10 months .
Luke 's Lobster " The number one thing that is challenging that we 're learning is how to preserve our company culture when we go from 10 people to 300 people to some day 1,000 people , " says Conniff . "
If that culture goes away at any point , then that 's time for us to stop growing . "
A family business After the first shack experienced higher - than - expected demand , Luke 's Lobster opened a second New York City location in May of 2010 .
Holden quit his job in finance , taking a $ 30,000 annual salary to run the business .
His mother cried . "
It was a tough moment for her , " Holden says . "
She had this , her oldest son who was supposed to be an example for his two younger brothers , wearing a suit , getting health insurance on somebody else 's liability line . "
Luke Holden grew up along the waters of Maine and followed his father and grandfather into the seafood business .
Luke Holden Instead , Holden had followed in his father 's and grandfather 's footsteps into an industry known for its high risks and unpredictability .
Holden had experienced the industry 's potential to create what his father called " feast and famine " growing up , depending on the year 's lobster supply and prices .
Over the past couple of years , the population and value of lobster has climbed significantly , but it fluctuates , and the Gulf of Maine Research Institute reports that warming waters will cause the area 's lobster population to decline by up to 62 percent by 2050 .
But Holden remains unequivocal in his passion for Luke 's Lobster . "
Being behind a desk in New York City just pounding away on a keyboard is not something that centers me , " Holden says . "
This was a complete passion project for me . "
Eventually , and against his mother 's wishes , Holden brought his two younger brothers , Bryan and Mike , into the business with him .
Bryan now oversees the company 's real estate while Mike focuses on training staff and opening new locations .

CNBC " I think she just kind of gave up , " Holden says about his mom 's initial skepticism . "
I think now she 's very proud of what her three boys have accomplished at Luke 's . "
Ocean to table Instead of working with a middleman , Luke 's Lobster purchases its lobster , shrimp and crab directly from certified , sustainable fisheries around Maine and Canada .
It 's the company 's way of directly supporting lobstermen and ensuring a sustainably - harvested fish supply .
Modern lobster harvesters haul lobsters by hand in traps .
CNBC At the company 's processing facility in Saco , Maine , approximately 32,000 pounds of lobster are cooked and prepared each day .
Different parts of the lobster -- claws , knuckles , bodies , legs and tails -- are separated , weighed and grouped into batches according to size .
The lobster is then divided into quarter - pound servings , bagged , packed and transported .
By the time the meat arrives at each of the 29 shacks across the country , it has been cut to perfection , divided into equal proportions and prepared for consumption .
This highly orchestrated process helps Luke 's Lobster ensure quality and cost - control at each of the company 's shacks , minimizing the type of disorder that slowed the company down in its early days .
Maine is responsible for producing more than 80 percent of the lobsters in the U.S. , according to analysis by Bloomberg .
CNBC Steering ahead With a growing national and international business and a number of philanthropic initiatives , the company Holden and Conniff started nearly nine years ago looks drastically different today .
In 2016 , Holden and Conniff brought in private equity investor Quilvest to help the company grow .
Quilvest now controls a minority stake in the company , while Holden , Conniff , Luke 's dad Jeff , and brother , Bryan , retain the majority . "
What I 've tried to do is surround my team and our organization with mentors that have been there and done that , " Holden says , " so that while we 're going 100 miles an hour trying to do what we think is best for the business [ and ] for the organization , we have outside guidance . "
Members of the Luke 's Lobster team take part in a lobster cook - out in the summer of 2017 .
CNBC Holden and Conniff remain committed to keeping Luke 's Lobster largely independent , family - run and socially responsible .
In January , the company became a certified B - corp , agreeing to meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance , accountability and transparency .
The status was hard - won and rare for a restaurant group .
Luke 's Lobster is now one of 17 restaurants to be B - corp certified , and the only seafood company .
To begin the certification process , Holden and Conniff had to convince their new investors and board it was a sound financial decision .
They also had to rewrite the company 's entire operating agreement .

That s amazing .
You do nt see that too often . "
For him to give back to the community , and help me with my game , that s a true blessing . "
An open house is being held at the Athletes Performance Enhancement facility on Saturday at 1 p.m. , for parents and youth athletes to meet Greene and the speed training program that he is providing .
Greene , who moved into the Valley three years ago , was one of the greatest sprinters from 1997 - 2004 , winning four Olympic medals , including two golds , and capturing five world championships .

When the UFC essentially bought out Leslie Smiths contract , Project Spearhead took a hit .
The organizations adivsor has made sure to point that out to the federal agency hearing the fighters labor complaint .
Project Spearhead advisor Lucas Middlebrook told MMAjunkie Radio there was a " precipitous decline " in union authorization cards collected by the organization after Smiths UFC departure .
He said several confidential witnesses stepped forward to testify " that the fear increased and the people retreated after they did what they did to Leslie . "
Middlebrook said Smiths complaint with the National Relations Board is an inevitable response to a bullying tactic by the UFC . "
There was no other choice but for Leslie to file this charge , in order to show the rest of the fighters what they did is illegal , " he said . "
And they re not going to do it to you , because they did it to me , and I m going to fight back .
I m going to show that its illegal , and there s a federal agency here that s designed to protect you . "
Recently , Smith and Middlebrook received a one - two of good and bad news from that agency .
The regional NLRB office that received Smiths complaint found merit in her allegation that the UFC engaged in retaliatory action against her attempts to organize fighters , only to be overruled by the national office , which said it needed to evaluate the case before proceeding .
Middlebrook said the turn of events was unusual because plaintiffs are usually given notice when a regional NLRB office needs advisement from the national office .
In this case , he and Smith found out after news of their victory had broken . "
We received a phone call saying this case has been decided on the merit determination , and only later to say , now , were being told it has to be sent to ( Washington , D.C. ) , " Middlebrook said . "
To me , in my opinion , smacks of political string - pulling . "

While some public figures are being hassled in public , at least one is receiving free dessert .
Rep. Ted Lieu was buying food at a Greek diner recently when the owner gave him free baklava and thanked him for his work in Congress . "
When I arrived , the owner saw me & threw in a free baklava ( one of my favorite desserts ) ... I guess that 's what happens when one opposes ripping kids away from parents , " Lieu tweeted Tuesday .
Lieu was likely referencing Trump adviser Stephen Miller , an architect of the " zero tolerance " policy that has led to thousands of children being separated from their families .
On Tuesday , the Washington Post published a report about Miller throwing away an $ 80 sushi takeout order recently after he was cursed out by one of the restaurant staffers .
Miller is far from the only public figure who has been harassed in public .

With a volatile first half of the year in the books , investors are looking ahead to what market trends could continue -- or reverse course -- in the second half .
One macro expert told CNBCs " Trading Nation " she s looking for a rotation to play out from so - called growth stocks into value stocks in the coming months .
Gina Sanchez , CEO of Chantico Global , explained why she s expecting beaten - down value names to fall back into favor . *
The consumer staples , industrials and telecom sectors proved to be the markets biggest losers in the first half of 2018 , and higher interest rates were thought to be the culprit of the underperformance .
Meanwhile , technology and consumer discretionary ( home to many " growth " stocks ) were the biggest winners . *
Now that caution has steadily crept back into the market this year amid rising global trade tensions , political uncertainty abroad and an increasingly aggressive Federal Reserve , investors may steadily return to these names that traditionally offer " safe " returns . *
Furthermore , expanding multiples of high - flying stocks within the technology and consumer discretionary have come into focus , which may tempt investors to ditch " growth " stocks and turn to " value . "
Bottom line : Value stocks , largely unloved in the first half of 2018 , may fall back into favor as investors grow cautious .

Workplace retirement plans get a lot of bad press , primarily if they are loaded with high fees .
But truth be told , 401(k ) retirement plans have been a boon to millions of Americans with access to them .
In total , 55 million savers held $ 5.3 trillion in these plans at the end of 2017 , according to industry data .
Put simply , 401(k)s work .
In addition to providing an income - tax break , the plans are designed to fend off our worst impulses .
For instance , you pay a penalty plus taxes due for withdrawing money too early .
So people tend to leave money alone to grow and compound -- and that s huge .
That s the good news .
The bad news is that otherwise - diligent savers can still leave money on the table with a 401(k ) , often without realizing it .
That s true even for those contributing the maximum amounts .
Read : A simple change to your 401(k ) statement could encourage you to save more for retirement If you care about maximizing your retirement , be careful about how you treat your plan and avoid making these unforced 401(k ) errors .
Here 's how to use compound interest to get rich Mistake No .
1 : Not saving in a 401(k ) It seems fundamental , but a shocking number of people simply ignore the opportunity to save for retirement in a workplace plan -- up to 60 % of eligible workers , according to one study .
To overcome human inertia , companies have started to enroll employees automatically .
Of course , many people do nt have access to a workplace savings plan .
A Pew Charitable Trusts study found that 35 % of workers aged 22 or older had no access to a 401(k ) .
While 80 % of baby boomers join a plan if offered one , just 52 % of millennials participate .
But even those who do have access to a 40l(k ) plan at work and do save that way can leave money on the table .
Read : How to save twice your salary ( or more ) by age 35 Mistake No .
2 : Not investing Even with automatic enrollment in place , between 80 % and 90 % of participants fail to pick any investment at all , leaving those contributions in cash .
Yet cash is subject to inflation and thus steadily loses value .
Stocks and bonds promise growth above inflation , protecting the purchasing power of your savings .
Companies are responding by creating default portfolios , nudging us to opt out of that choice rather than to opt into it .
Typically , this means a target - date fund , a type of all - in - one portfolio based on your age and retirement goals .
That s better than cash for sure , but target - date products can be too conservative , especially since we all are living longer in retirement .
Read : Should retirees hold onto equities ?
Not necessarily Mistake No 3 : Not getting the free money Many companies incentivize saving by offering to match 401(k ) contributions up to a specific amount each year .
Saving less than the match is turning away free money .
For that reason , default accounts often start out saving at the matching level .
A typical match is 50 cents for each dollar you save up to 6 % of your pay .
So if you make $ 50,000 a year , the first $ 3,000 you put in a 401(k ) would be matched with $ 1,500 from your employer .
Some employers do less , matching only up to 3 % of your salary .
While there can be a lot of corporate reasons for the difference , its worth asking why .
While you should strive to save up to the IRS maximum -- $ 18,500 in 2018 and $ 24,500 if you are 50 or older -- getting your companys full match is the minimum you should do .
Mistake No .
4 : Missing out on company matches by front - loading contributions This mistake may afflict aggressive savers who feel they should max out their 401(k ) as quickly as possible each year .
But having zero contributions in later pay periods risks not get all the matches you are due because some employers spread out their payments over the entire year .
And if there is no contribution by you in one pay period , there is no match either .
Some employers will " true up " contributions to make sure you get the full amount , or make annualized matches to even out the year , but policies vary from company to company .
A Deloitte study found that nearly nine in 10 companies match per pay period -- and just 45 % conduct a true - up .
Talk to your human - resources department before you front - load your 401(k ) .
5 simple steps to reach $ 1 million Mistake No .
5 : Paying high fees A lot of small companies choose whichever 401(k ) provider makes a pitch that best responds to their own needs , such as reduced paperwork if the firm ca nt manage the plans in house .
Yet these " easy " solutions can be loaded with higher - than - average fees -- paid by employees .
That does nt mean you ca nt advocate for yourself !
Once you re in a plan , choose low - cost index funds over costly active mutual funds .
A BrightScope study finds that 98 % of 401(k ) plan participants have access to index funds in their plan , but just 31 % of total plan assets are in low - cost funds vs. more costly mutual funds .
While digging into the fees in your plan can be fairly complicated and can vary according to your investment choices , its worth doing .
Your human - resources department should be able to provide a human - readable breakdown .
You also can compare your plan against others by simply searching for it at Brightscope.com .
Mistake No .
6 : Trying to time the market People tend to ignore their 401(k ) balance for a long time .
Then one day they open a statement and find out that they are 401(k ) millionaires .
Thanks to the power of time -- known in investing as compounding -- it happens .
In effect , your money starts to make money on its own , pushing up your account balance dramatically in the later years regardless of your continued contributions .
Money prudently invested doubles , then doubles again , and then again , like folding a single sheet of paper until its too fat to fold even once more . (
You ca nt get past seven folds without serious help . )
The problem is that the method that got them rich -- a risk - adjusted portfolio -- falls by the wayside as the employee tries to trade his or her way to even greater riches .
Soon , a diversified portfolio becomes concentrated , the market changes course , and the once - fat 401(k ) starts to look like a 201(k ) .
Stick with what got you there , and compounding will take care of the rest .
Prudently invested , $ 1 in 10 years should turn into $ 2 , but then 10 years later its $ 4 , then $ 8 , and then $ 16 -- even though you have nt saved another cent .
Read : More than 40 % of Americans are at risk of going broke in retirement -- and that s the good news Mistake No .
7 : Having orphaned accounts Most Americans these days spend just a few years in any one firm .
We hold 10 jobs by age 40 and 12 to 15 jobs in a lifetime , according to government data .
In many of those jobs , though , we do last long enough to start a 401(k ) -- and then leave it behind .
Too often , those orphaned accounts are frittered away in high - fee plans .
Read:401(k ) accounts need to be easier to move from job to job Having multiple 401(k)s is risky in another way too .
They likely are invested in very different ways .
You might have been mostly in stocks in your 20s , then in a 60%-40 % mix of stocks and bonds in your 30s .
Then maybe back to mostly stocks during a time when the economy boomed .
Figuring out what you own now , and if the risk you take is appropriate , is nearly impossible with scattered money .
Better to roll those old balances over into an IRA and understand your real investment risk .
Properly reinvested into a single account , it becomes much easier to choose investments for a portfolio that fits your long - term goals while keeping costs down .
Small problems such as missing matching money and high fund fees add up to big dollars over decades .
The key is to take control of your financial future by paying attention to how your money is managed , no matter what stage you are in your career .
Your future , retired self will thank you .

Wrestlers in ancient Greece competed in the nude as spectators watched .
Wrestlers at Ohio State say they showered in the nude while voyeurs watched .
The difference is a matter of privacy and consent : The ancient Olympic athletes competed willingly while the former college athletes say they complained to their coaches about the creeps who they allege gawked at them decades ago .
The former Ohio State wrestlers told Politico that some men who attended the university or worked there " would masturbate while watching " as the wrestlers showered or sat in the sauna .
The sordid scandal offers echoes of the sex abuse of boys at Penn State and of girls at USA Gymnastics - and includes allegations of a doctor abusing wrestlers during medical exams , as happened to the gymnasts and to female athletes at Michigan State .
More : Jim Jordan defender : Ohio State locker room talk included ' prepare to drop your pants ESPN The Magazines " Body Issue " celebrates the nude forms of willing female and male athletes and offers echoes of the idealized athletic nudity of antiquity .
The ancient Greek word for naked -- gymnos -- is the root word for gymnasium , the sacred space where young Greek men conditioned their bodies as well as their minds . "
The gymnasium was very connected to the sport of wrestling - and other sports too , of course - and they worked out either in the nude or essentially with small cloths around their genitals , " says Bruce Kidd , a professor of kinesiology and physical education at the University of Toronto and an expert on the ancient Olympic Games . "
I guess the thing I m worried about in terms of historical parallels , " he says , " it does nt sound like the ( Ohio State ) athletes were willing participants .
It sounds like there was unwanted gazing and taking advantage of medical examinations . "
Athletic male bodies served as symbols of the civilization in ancient Greece , celebrated for centuries by artists and sculptors . "
Look at the statues , " Kidd says . "
Go to the Louvre .
The U.S. has many wonderful exhibits of classical Greek culture and they show off the male form . "
Michelangelo sculpted his Renaissance masterpiece David in the Greek tradition of the heroic male nude .
And it was in that same tradition that the modern Olympics for decades offered official posters depicting athletic male nudes . "
There has been a tradition of celebration of the male body - in live form and in sculpture and in art - associated with the ancient and modern Olympic Games , " Kidd says .
The alleged voyeurism at Ohio State represents " an abuse of what has long been , in the right circumstances , an important tradition of western culture , " he says . "
That is totally unacceptable . "
The Old Testament , which tells the story of David , also offers Adam and Eve .
Genesis tells us they did not feel shame for their nakedness until they brought sin into the world .
The bodies of toned athletes , male and female , are objectively beautiful .
And the sin of sexual abuse , especially of children , is unutterably ugly .

Yaniv " Nev " Schulman of the popular MTV series " Catfish " is getting candid about the sexual misconduct allegations he faced in May that resulted in an investigation and the temporary suspension of the show .
During an interview with People Wednesday , the host opened up about his experience with the investigation , saying he felt " powerless . "
Production resumed in June after the investigation found claims were " not credible and without merit , " MTV confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline . "
I m doing much better now .
It was a really difficult time for me , as much for my wife and my family , " he said " To be accused of something that I squarely did not do and to have the harsh judgment that followed and no way to counteract or do something in the moment to correct that was very difficult .
It was frustrating .
I just felt so powerless . "
The allegations came to light in two YouTube videos uploaded by Ayissha Morgan , who appeared on the show three years ago .
In the videos , titled " The TRUTH about the show " she outlined her experience , alleging " Jack " ( a label she gave to the show 's " main person " ) made several inappropriate , sexual comments .
Schulman also said he was " overwhelmed " by the support he received from his fans and crew and urged that he lives within the values represented in " Catfish , " namely , honesty . "
I ve lived a number of different lives in my 33 years .
I ve experienced different things , I ve been in different social circles and I ve made mistakes .
I ve been very honest about those and I ve been accountable , I ve apologized and done everything I could to make right where I may have wronged , " he explained .
Schulman also denied the allegations in an emailed statement to USA TODAY after the allegations were made . "
The behavior described in this video did not happen and I m fortunate that there are a number of former colleagues who were present during this time period who are willing to speak up with the truth , " he said . "
I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions - but these claims are false . " "
Catfish " follows Schulman and co - host Max Joseph as they uncover the true identities of people 's online love interests .
Some end up being who they say they are , while others are " catfish , " or someone who poses as someone else .
Schulman , 33 , also serves as an executive producer on the show .
He is married to Laura Perlongo .
They have a daughter , Cleo James .

You already know you should nt tap your retirement plan to fund frivolous purchases , yet in a handful of cases it just might be okay to take a loan .
Retirement plans account for a large chunk of personal wealth : The average 401(k ) plan account balance at Fidelity Investments hit $ 102,900 as of the end of the first quarter of 2018 .
In order to get the most out of your retirement plan , you should let the money accumulate over the course of your career .
Time and compounding market returns are your 401(k ) plans best friends .
But , sometimes , emergencies and long - term planning goals will call for the more drastic step of taking a plan loan . "
Plan participants understand that the money is sacrosanct , but they may find themselves in a situation where the 401(k ) is the largest source of capital they have , " said James A. Cox , financial advisor at Harris Financial Group in Richmond , Virginia .
Here 's how to borrow from your 401(k ) without ending up with a big tax bill .
Loans , withdrawals , hardship Retirement plan loans are different from withdrawals and hardship distributions .
Depending on whether your plan permits borrowing , you 're generally allowed to take up to 50 percent of your vested account balance to a max of $ 50,000 -- whichever is less .
You have five years to repay the loan .
That 's different from simply withdrawing money .
In that case , your plan administrator will withhold 20 percent of the amount to cover income taxes and you 'll trigger a 10 percent penalty if you 're under age 59 1/2 .
Finally , a " hardship distribution " is what happens when an employee pulls his or her own contributions to cover what the IRS describes as an " unforeseeable emergency . "
These distributions are included in your gross annual income and may be subject to additional taxes , but they are n't repaid to the plan .
This means they permanently lower your account balance at work .
When you can borrow Jamie Grill | Getty Images Once you pull money out of your plan , those dollars no longer benefit from long - term market returns .
If you have a pool of emergency funds , it 's best to use that money first .
If you 're managing debt , it 's even better to build that repayment into your budget .
Even your boss wants you to keep your hands off your retirement plan savings .
That said , here are three extreme cases that may warrant a 401(k ) loan .
You have an immediate emergency . "
Say that you need to meet the deductible on your high - deductible health - care plan , and you have no money in your health savings account , " said Aaron Pottichen , president of retirement services at CLS Partners in Austin , Texas .

What not to do Thomas EyeDesign | Vetta | Getty Images In the worst of scenarios , you 'll borrow from your retirement plan , fail to repay it and end up with your finances in even worse shape .
Do n't borrow if you 're planning on leaving .
Whether you quit your job or you 're fired , you may need to repay the whole balance of your loan within 60 days or else the amount borrowed is considered a taxable distribution .
Do n't ignore your debt - to - income ratio .
Treat your plan loan the way you would any other extension of credit .
The classic rule of thumb is that no more than 36 percent of your gross monthly income should go toward servicing debt .
This is known as the debt - to - income ratio .
Do n't blow off your plan 's rules for loans .
A 2016 study from Aon Hewitt revealed that six in 10 employers have said they 'd take steps to curtail the leakage of assets from retirement plans .
Those actions include limiting the number of loans available or the amount of money that 's eligible for borrowing .
Plans can also establish their own repayment and schedules , which you 'll need to follow . "
When you take a 401(k ) loan , it comes out of payroll and reduces your take home pay , " said Cox . "
Either you follow the payment schedule or you fully remit the balance due . "

You 've probably seen his face on televisions , billboards and TARC buses around Louisville or listened to his pitch on the radio .
But who is John Morgan , the attorney representing a group of former Louisville Cardinals men 's basketball players in its lawsuit against the NCAA ?
Morgan is the founder of Morgan & Morgan , a personal injury law firm based in Florida .
According to its website , the firm includes more than 400 attorneys at offices in more than 10 states , including Kentucky , and they recover close to $ 1 billion for its clients a year .
He was in Louisville on Wednesday to discuss the players ' lawsuit .

He added that he bleeds " BBN , " short for the Kentucky Wildcats ' Big Blue Nation , and joked that he was going to get a hot brown at the Brown Hotel after the press conference .
He tagged the tweets with his catchphrase , " For The People . "
But despite taking on the NCAA , Morgan is well - known in Florida for taking on a different cause -- expanding the use of medical marijuana .
In 2016 , he successfully led efforts to sway taxpayers to pass Amendment 2 , which broadened the use of the drug for medical patients .
He personally contributed $ 6.7 million , including television and radio ads , to support the measure , according to the Orlando Business Times .
But Florida lawmakers later limited the amendment 's scope by directing patients who qualify to obtain medical marijuana to use only oils , sprays , tinctures , vaping and edibles .
Morgan sued Florida and won to allow medical marijuana patients to smoke the drug , though that decision is on hold pending an appellate court hearing , according to the Tampa Bay Times .
Morgan has also been active in political campaign circles and even considered a run for governor in Florida .
The New York Times reported that he donated to Democrat Hillary Clinton during her presidential campaign in 2016 .
